# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Legacy](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Legacy) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). The machine is running an old version of windows with SMB, we use a module from metasploit to get access.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.4

We have a windows XP machine running SMB.

# **Foothold**

Searching for windows XP SMB exploit we find that there is a metasploit module named `(MS08â€“067)` allowing us to get remote code execution.

Let's fire up `metasploit` and use the following module `exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi`

After setting the lhost and rhost options, we run the exploit and get a reverse shell with system privileges.
