## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Cap](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Cap) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). We find a webserver with an `IDOR` vulnerability that gives access to another user's pcap capture. The latter contains a plain text password that can be used to get foothold. A linux capability is then leveraged to get root.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal

```

There are 3 open ports, 21(FTP), 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP). Since we have no credentials for the first two services, let's check the webserver.

### Web

Navigate to the website http://10.10.10.245/

![](1.png)

We that we are already logged in as `Nathan`. Looking through the website, we find the following sidebar. 

![](2.png)

Going to Security Snapshots we get the following.

![](3.png)

From the description, this is a 5 second PCAP + Analysis, and if we hit the download button we get pcap file.

One other interesting thing to notice is the URL, the id of the current page is 1, let's try a different number, say 0 for example.

![](4.png)

We got a different analysis, let's download the pcap file and inspect it using wireshark.

![](5.png)

We found the password for ftp.

## **Foothold**

### FTP

Let's login as nathan to the ftp server.

![](6.png)

We logged in successfully, and seems we're in nathan's home directory.

### SSH

Let's use the same password and login via SSH this time.

![](7.png)

Great! We got in.

## **Privilege Escalation**

After some basic enumeration on the machine, i checked the capabilities with this command `getcap -r / 2>/dev/null` and found the following.

![](8.png)

The `/usr/bin/python3.8` have the `cap_setuid` capability. Let's go check [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/#capabilities) for ways the escalate our privileges using that.

![](9.png)

We need to run the following command.

```bash
/usr/bin/python3.8 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/sh")'
```

![](10.png)

Great! We got root access.
