# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Base](https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?tier=2) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). The box is running ssh on port 22 and a web server on port 80. On the website we find there is a login page that uses a vulnerable function to check valid credentials, we exploit that function to login and upload a reverse shell. Once we're in the box, we find a user's password inside a website file. The user is able to run the `find` as root, so we exploit that to get a root shell.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal

```

There are two open ports, 22(SSH) and 80(HTTP).

## Web

Let's start enumerating the web server.

![](1.png)

We have a file hosting service named `Base`. We can see that there is a **login** button, byt clicking it, we are presented with a login page.

![](2.png)

From the URL of the login page `http://10.129.243.35/login/login.php`, we notice that there is a login directory with the `login.php` file stored in it. Let's go to the login directory by removing `login.php` from the URL.

![](3.png)

We find 3 files, the first two (config.php and login.php) can't be read or downloaded, but we can download the `login.php.swp` file. According to this [website](https://fileinfo.com/extension/swp), An SWP file is a swap file created by the Vi text editor or one of its variants, such as Vim (Vi iMproved) and gVim. It stores the recovery version of a file being edited in the program.

We can open the login.php.swp file using the command `vim -r config.php.swp`.

The following part is what concerns us.

```php
<?php
session_start();
if (!empty($_POST['username']) && !empty($_POST['password'])) {
    require('config.php');
    if (strcmp($username, $_POST['username']) == 0) {
        if (strcmp($password, $_POST['password']) == 0) {
            $_SESSION['user_id'] = 1;
            header("Location: /upload.php");
        } else {
            print("<script>alert('Wrong Username or Password')</script>");
        }
    } else {
        print("<script>alert('Wrong Username or Password')</script>");
    }
}
?>
```

The above php code is the one handling the login.

This file checks the username/password combination that the user submits against the variables that are stored in the config.php file to see if they match.

The function used to check the username and password combination is the `strcmp()` function.

I googled `strcmp authentication bypass` and found this [writeup](https://blog.0daylabs.com/2015/09/21/csaw-web-200-write-up/) from another CTF explaining how to exploit this `strcmp` function.

# **Foothold**

The thing we need to do is change the username and password variables in the POST request to `username[]` and `password[]`.

## BurpSuite

Let's fire up burp suite and intercept a login request.

![](4.png)

Now let's change the username and password variables to the following.

![](5.png)

This converts the variables to arrays and after forwarding the request, strcmp() returns true and the login is successful.

When we forward the request, we get a file upload form.

Let's upload a [reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php).

Once the file is uploaded, we need to find where it goes, so let's run a directory scan using gobuster.`gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt -u http://10.129.10.10/`.

```terminal

===============================================================
```

We found `/_uploaded` directory, let's go see if our file is there.

![](7.png)

It's there, let's setup a netcat listener using this command `nc -lvnp 1234` and request to reverse shell php file.

![](8.png)

We're in.

# **Privilege Escalation**

The first thing we need to do is see what's on the `config.php` we saw earlier.

![](9.png)

We found a password! But what's the user. Listing the content of **/home** directory we find **john**'s directory.

Let's use that password and login to john's account with ssh.

![](10.png)

Great! Let's check our current privileges with `sudo -l`.

![](11.png)

We can run `find` as root. A quick search on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/#sudo), we find a way to get root using `find`.

![](12.png)

Let's run that command: `sudo find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit`.

![](13.png)

Nice!
