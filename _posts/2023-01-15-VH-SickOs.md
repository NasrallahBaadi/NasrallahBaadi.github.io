# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [SickOs 1.1](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sickos-11,132/) from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.18
Host is up (0.00046s latency).
Not shown: 997 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE  SERVICE    VERSION

```

We found two open ports, 22 running OpenSSH and 3128 is Squid http proxy.

## Web

Let's first set our firefox proxy setting to use 192.168.56.18:3128 as a proxy.

Now let's navigate to the web page at port 80.

![](2.png)

Nothing here, let's run a directory scan.

![](3.png)

We found `robots` file, when we navigate to it, we find the directory `wolfcms`

![](4.png)

Searching for this CMS, i found that there is a login page at `/wolfcms/?/admin/login`

![](5.png)

I tried the credentials `admin:admin` and logged in successfully.

# **Foothold**

Checking different tabs, i managed to find an upload functionality that i used to upload a php reverse shell.

![](7.png)

Now i setup a listener and requested the file that's located at `/wolfcms/public`

![](8.png)

# **Privilege Escalation**

Checking the config file of wolfcms we can find the database password.

![](9.png)

Using that password, i managed to change to `sickos` user who had full sudo permissions which we used to get root.
