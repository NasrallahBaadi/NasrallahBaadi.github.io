# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Team](https://tryhackme.com/room/teamcw) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). After scanning the machine and finding a webserver, we discover a subdomain vulnerable to lfi giving the ability to read files on the system and finding an ssh private key giving us foothold to the machine. After that we find we can run a script as another user that doesn't handle user input in a secure way, so we exploit that to upgrade to that user. With our new user, we discover a script that's being run as a cronjob and that we can edit that script, so we edit the script to give us root shell.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal

```

There are tree open ports on Ubuntu Linux machine, port 21 running vsftpd, port 22 running OpenSSH and port 80 running Apache.

## Web

Let's navigate to the web page.

![](1.png)

It's the Apache2 Ubuntu default page. Let's check the source code.

![](2.png)

In the title element, we found a message stating that we need to add team.thm to our /etc/hosts file, os let's do that and navigate to the domain.

![](3.png)

Let's run a directory scan.

```terminal

===============================================================
```

We found robots.txt which contains a possible username.

Let's scan the target for subdomains using the following command:

```bash
ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://team.thm -H "Host: FUZZ.team.thm" --fw 3512 
```

![](4.png)

Found `dev` subdomain, let's add to our hosts and navigate to it.

![](5.png)

There is a link in this page redirecting us to `http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=teamshare.php`.

Let's see if this parameter is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion by requesting `http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=../../../../etc/passwd`

![](6.png)


# **Foothold**

I checked `dale`'s home directory for an ssh key as well as `gyles` but could find anything, but if we check ssh config file at `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, we find a private ssh key.

```
http://dev.team.thm/script.php?page=../../../../etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

![](7.png)

Let's copy that to our machine, give it the right permission and connect with it.

![](8.png)


# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check our current privileges with `sudo -l`.

```terminal
dale@TEAM:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for dale on TEAM:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User dale may run the following commands on TEAM:
    (gyles) NOPASSWD: /home/gyles/admin_checks
dale@TEAM:~$ 

```

We can run a script called `admin_checks` as `gyles`, let's check the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

printf "Reading stats.\n"
sleep 1
printf "Reading stats..\n"
sleep 1
read -p "Enter name of person backing up the data: " name
echo $name  >> /var/stats/stats.txt
read -p "Enter 'date' to timestamp the file: " error
printf "The Date is "
$error 2>/dev/null

date_save=$(date "+%F-%H-%M")
cp /var/stats/stats.txt /var/stats/stats-$date_save.bak

printf "Stats have been backed up\n"
```

We can see in line nice, the scripts takes input from the user and put it in variable `error`, then in line 11, whatever in the `error` variable gets executed.

We can enter `/bin/bash` and it will be executed giving a shell as `gyles`.

![](9.png)

As gyles, I uploaded a copy of linpeas, run it and got the following.

![](10.png)

There is an interesting file that we can edit named `main_backup.sh`. Let's check it out.

![](11.png)

The script copies the content of team.thm and put in a backup directory. When we check that backup, we notice that it's been done very recently, so there must a cronjob running.

I added the following command to the script that would make a copy of bash in /tmp and give suid bit.

```bash
cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash
```

![](12.png)

Great! We got root.
