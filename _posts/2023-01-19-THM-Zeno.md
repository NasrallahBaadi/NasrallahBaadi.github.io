# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Zeno](https://tryhackme.com/room/zeno) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 -p- {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

- -p-: scan all ports.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.138.170
Host is up (0.11s latency).

PORT      STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp    open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.4 (protocol 2.0)

```

We found two open ports, port 22 running OpenSSH 7.4 and port 12340 running an Apache web server.

## Web

Let's check the web page.

Nothing useful so let's run a directory scan.

```terminal

===============================================================

```

Let's check `/rms/ page.`

![](2.png)

It's a Restaurant Management System for a hotel.

Searching on google for exploits in RMS we find the following.

![](3.png)

# **Foothold**

Let's download this [exploit](https://github.com/AlperenY-cs/rms_hunt) and run it against the target system.

![](4.png)

Now we can execute command at `/rms/images?cmd={command}`. Using that i uploaded a php reverse shell using `curl`.

![](5.png)

Now i setup a listener and requested the php file.

# **Privilege Escalation**

After running `linpeas` we found some interesting results.

![](7.png)

Here we can see the database credentials, but they're not really useful to us.

![](8.png)

Linpeas also found that we have write permission over a service as well as some credentials found in `/etc/fstab`

Using the credentials we can switch to user `edward`.

![](9.png)

User edward can reboot the machine. With the that and the ability to write a service file, we can exploit that to get a command executed as root.

Let's edit `/etc/systemd/system/zeno-monitoring.service` file and put a command that would give bash the suid bit.

![](10.png)

Now let's reboot the machine, wait a little bit and then ssh to the machine as edward.
