## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Bank](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/bank) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.


```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.29
Host is up (0.27s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 6.6.1p1 Ubuntu 2ubuntu2.8 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

We have port 21 running OpenSSH, port 53 is DNS and port 80 is an Apache web server.

### Web

Let's navigate to the web page.

![](1.png)

It'a Apache default page.

Let's try adding bank.htb to /etc/hosts file and see if we get any different results.

![](2.png)

We got redirected to a login page. I tired sql injection but not luck.

Let's run a directory scan.

![](4.png)

We found an interesting directory called `balance-transfer`, let's check it out.

![](3.png)

There are lots of files here, bu one files really stands out for having a smaller size than others.

![](5.png)

Let's download it and see what's there.

```terminal
└──╼ $ cat 68576f20e9732f1b2edc4df5b8533230.acc
--ERR ENCRYPT FAILED

```


## **Foothold**

Using those credentials, let's login at http://bank.htb/login.php

![](6.png)

At the support page, we see that we can create tickets and upload files to the server.

![](7.png)

I tried to upload a php reverse shell but it didn't work.

![](8.png)

Let's intercept the request using Burp and see what's been filtered.

![](9.png)

After another attempt to upload a php file, we see in the response a comment stating that `.htb` extension is being executed as php.

Now let's change the name of our file from shell.php to shell.htb and upload it.

![](10.png)

Great! We got a shell.


## **Privilege Escalation**

After some basic enumeration on the machine, checking for suid files we find the following.

![](11.png)

The file /var/htb/bin/emergency has suid bit. Let's run it and see what it does.

![](12.png)

It just gave us a root shell, that was easy.
