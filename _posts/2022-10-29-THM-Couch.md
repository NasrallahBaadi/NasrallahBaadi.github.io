## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Couch](https://tryhackme.com/room/couch) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 -p- {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

- -p-: Scan all ports.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.49.174
Host is up (0.13s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp   open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 34:9d:39:09:34:30:4b:3d:a7:1e:df:eb:a3:b0:e5:aa (RSA)
|   256 a4:2e:ef:3a:84:5d:21:1b:b9:d4:26:13:a5:2d:df:19 (ECDSA)
|_  256 e1:6d:4d:fd:c8:00:8e:86:c2:13:2d:c7:ad:85:13:9c (ED25519)
5984/tcp open  http    CouchDB httpd 1.6.1 (Erlang OTP/18)
|_http-title: Site doesn't have a title (text/plain; charset=utf-8).
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

There are two open ports, 22 running OpenSSH and 5984 running CouchDB.

We can connect to CounchDB simply using our browser. Let's navigate to it.

I Googled for `couchdb pentest` and found this [article](https://www.hackingarticles.in/penetration-testing-on-couchdb-5984/) explaining how to do so.

Let's navigate to `_utils`.

![](2.png)

We found called `secret`. Clicking on it redirects us to the following page.

Now clicking on the value, we go to a page where we find a username and password.

## **Foothold**

Using the credentials we found, let's connect to the machine via ssh.

## **Privilege Escalation**

Checking the files of atena's home directory, we find that the history file is not empty.

![](6.png)

If we check it, we find the following command:

```bash
docker -H 127.0.0.1:2375 run --rm -it --privileged --net=host -v /:/mnt alpine
```

This one looks like the command we use to escalate privileges if we can run docker as root.

Let's run it and see what happens.
