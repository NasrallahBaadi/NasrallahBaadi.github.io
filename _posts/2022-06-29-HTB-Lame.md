## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Lame](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Lame) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). The target is running an FTP server and Samba, both are vulnerable to command execution but only one is exploitable.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal

Host is up (0.13s latency).

```

We see that there is a running FTP server with anonymous login enabled, ssh and SMB.


### FTP

Let's login to that FTP server as anonymous.

![](1.png)

Nothing there. Let's search for any vulnerabilities in this version of vsftpd.

![](2.png)

The version of FTP running on this machine is vulnerable to command execution, but it's not exploitable in this box.

### SMB

Enumerating smb could be done using either `enum4linux` or `smbclient`, but we can't get much information with that, so let's search for vulnerabilities.

![](3.png)

There is a command execution vulnerability in this version of Samba.

## **Foothold**

Let's use the correct metasploit module for this vulnerability. 

![](4.png)

After setting up the required options, let's run the module.

Great! We got access as root.
