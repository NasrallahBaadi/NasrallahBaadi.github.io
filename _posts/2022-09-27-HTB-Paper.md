## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Paper](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/Paper) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.143

There are 3 open ports, 22(ssh), 80(http) and 443(ssl/http)

### Web

Let's navigate to the webpage `http://10.10.11.143` .

![](1.png)

We got the default page of CentOS Apache server.

Using the developer tool, let's check the network tab.

![](2.png)

We can see that the status code for this default page is 403 forbidden and not index.html which is weird. Checking the headers, we find one of them leaking the domain name `office.paper`.

Let's add the domain to our /etc/hosts file and navigate to it.

![](3.png)

We found the website of a paper company. In one of the posts, we find an interesting comment.

![](4.png)

Let's enumerate for subdomains

```terminal
$ ffuf -c -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt -u http://office.paper -H "Host: FUZZ.office.paper" --fs 199691 | tee scans/ffuf

```

We found a subdomain called `chat`, let's add it to /etc/hosts file and go see what's there.

![](6.png)

We found a login page for rocket.chat

So far we know that adding `?static=1` to a wordpress URL should leak its secret content

Here are a few ways to manipulate the returned entries:

- `order` with `asc` or `desc`
- `orderby`
- `m` with `m=YYYY`, `m=YYYYMM` or `m=YYYYMMDD` date format


In this case, simply reversing the order of the returned elements suffices and `http://wordpress.local/?static=1&order=asc` will show the secret content: 
```

We see that adding `?static=1` to the url leaks secrets, maybe that's what Nick was talking about. `http://office.paper/?static=1`

![](5.png)

Great! We got a secret registration url for `rocket.chat`. Let's create an account.

![](7.png)

![](8.png)

## **Foothold**

After successfully creating an account, we check the general chat and find something interesting.

![](9.png)

There is a bot called `recyclops` that can read and list files for us. 

Let's see what we can get with that.

![](10.png)

Found out there is a user named `dwight`, and i managed to list the content of his home directory by sending the message `recyclops list ../` to `recyclops` bot.

After listing a bunch of file, i found an `env` in /home/dwight/hubot/ directory. I print it out with `recyclops file ../hubot/.env`

![](11.png)

We got recyclops's password.

Since the bot was added by `dwight`, let's login to his account via ssh with the password we found.

![](12.png)

## **Privilege Escalation**

Check the kernel version with `uname -a`

```terminal
[dwight@paper ~]$ uname -a
Linux paper 4.18.0-348.7.1.el8_5.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Dec 22 13:25:12 UTC 2021 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

This version is vulnerable to CVE-2021-3650.

The one who discovered this vulnerability has released a proof of concept that we can find [here](https://github.com/secnigma/CVE-2021-3560-Polkit-Privilege-Esclation).

Let's upload the script to our target and run it.

```bash
./poc.sh -u=username -p=password -f=y
```

![](13.png)

And just like that we got root.
