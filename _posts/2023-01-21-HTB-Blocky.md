## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing **Blocky** from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.37
Host is up (0.13s latency).
Not shown: 996 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp   open   ftp     ProFTPD 1.3.5a
22/tcp   open   ssh     OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.2 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 d6:2b:99:b4:d5:e7:53:ce:2b:fc:b5:d7:9d:79:fb:a2 (RSA)
|   256 5d:7f:38:95:70:c9:be:ac:67:a0:1e:86:e7:97:84:03 (ECDSA)
|_  256 09:d5:c2:04:95:1a:90:ef:87:56:25:97:df:83:70:67 (ED25519)
80/tcp   open   http    Apache httpd 2.4.18
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://blocky.htb
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
8192/tcp closed sophos
Service Info: Host: 127.0.1.1; OSs: Unix, Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

The target has three open ports, 21 running ProFTPD 1.3.5a, port 22 with OpenSSH 7.2p2 and port 80 is an Apache http webserver.

Nmap title script show that when we visit the web site we get redirected to `http://blocky.htb`, so let's add that to /etc/hosts and visit the website.

From the links of the web page we can tell that it's running wordpress.

Let's use `wpscan` to enumerate for users and vulnerable plugins

```terminal
$ wpscan --url http://blocky.htb/ -e u,vp

===============================================================

```

We found some interesting directories, checking each one of them we find that /plugins contains some java file for us.

![](2.png)

Let's download the blockycore.jar file and inspect it.

## **Foothold**

Jar files are zip compressed files so we can unzip it.

![](3.png)

On the class file we see a sqlhost, sqluser and sqlpass.

Using that password, we can ssh to the target as user `notch`.

![](4.png)

## **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check notch's privileges.

![](5.png)

We can run any command as root so we run `sudo su` to get a root shell.
