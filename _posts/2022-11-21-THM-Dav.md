# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Dav](https://tryhackme.com/room/bsidesgtdav) from [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). The machine is running a web server with webdav that uses default credentials, allowing us to upload a reverse shell and get foothold. After that we exploit a sudo entry to read any file we want in the system.

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.196.193
Host is up (0.093s latency).
Not shown: 999 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page: It works
```

We found port 80 open running Apache http web server.

## Web

Navigate to the web page.

It's the default page of Apache2.

### Gobuster

Let's run a directory scan.

```terminal
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://10.10.196.193/

===============================================================
```

We found a directory called **/webdav**, let's check it out.

![](2.png)

We're prompt for a username and password, unfortunately we don't have any.

Searching on google for webdav default credentials we manage to find them in this [website](https://xforeveryman.blogspot.com/2012/01/helper-webdav-xampp-173-default.html).

![](3.png)

Let's login.

![](4.png)

We found a file that has a username and a hash, but doesn't really help us.

# **Foothold**

Since we got the correct credentials, we can use a tool called [cadaver](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/network-services-pentesting/pentesting-web/put-method-webdav#cadaver) to upload a [reverse shell](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) to the web server.

![](5.png)

Now we setup a listener and click on the file we uploaded on the web page.

![](6.png)

We should see a reverse shell pop up.

![](7.png)

We use python pty to stabilize the shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's check out privileges with `sudo -l`.

```terminal
www-data@ubuntu:/home$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/cat

```

We can run cat as root, we can easily read the /root/root.txt file with `sudo cat /root/root.txt`.
